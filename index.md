# A couple of implementation notes:

# On hover the "photo credit" group of the overlay + camera icon will need to show the photog's name & the Flickr link. We could do it in a tooltip or have the camera and the background animate out to the left to reveal (maybe like this (https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5898b0df360a663b5f25d60a/59108e2f7a1ae491f734efb3/792e8d010dc44a81e6705551f93195a2/possible-rollover-for-image-credit.png) ). On mobile, thinking just tapping the camera icon would take you to the Flickr page. Open to suggestions!

# For projects, we're seeing 2 tile typesâ€”active (Shed) & inactive (Deck). The entire tile is meant to be hot. I need to do an icon for Deck, but thinking there will be one there for inactive, just desaturated. Wondering if we can just upload the icon once for a project & have the site desaturate/saturate it based on whether it's active or not.

# I haven't worked out hover/active states for the tiles yet
