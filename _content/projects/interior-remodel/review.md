title: The Review Process for an Interior Remodel Permit in Austin
step_number: 4
project_name: interior-remodel
---


After submitting your application, you enter into the review process. During review, you and the city work together to make sure your plans are:

* Up to code,
* Safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors,
* And long-lasting.

### What is the review process?

#### 1. Approval or Comments

A set of reviewers will be looking through your application and checking your plans for compliance against both the [IRC (International Residential Code)](https://www.iccsafe.org/codes-tech-support/codes/2015-i-codes/irc/) and the [LDC (Land Development Code)](https://www.municode.com/library/tx/austin/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT25LADE). They will either approve your application or attach comments in a Master Comment Report. This process takes about 15 business days.

You can check the status of your permit application on [Austin Build + Connect](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/index). To check your permit status, you must create an Austin Build + Connect account and select “My Permits/Cases” from the left side menu.

Note that if you are not the applicant, meaning a hired professional submitted your application, the hired professional will be receiving the approval of  your permit application or any review comments. You can request to be sent a copy of any emails if this is the case, or you can simply have your authorized applicant forward them to you.

#### 2. If you receive comments, your plans must be adjusted

Comments are sent in a Master Comment Report to the email provided on the application.

If you need help understanding your comments, reference the [Municipal Code](https://www.municode.com/library/tx/austin/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=THCOAUTE01) and [glossary](/resources/glossary/) or speak with a professional.

If you have questions or concerns about your comments, you can reach out to the reviewer associated with the specific comments directly. This information will be located on your comment document.

#### 3. Submit updated plans

Resubmission is done through the same process as your initial [application submission](http://alpha.webuildthis.city/projects/deck#how-do-i-submit-my-application?).

After you or your hired professional resubmit, you will receive either notice that your plans have been approved or you will receive new comments. Note that if you receive comments a second time, there is an additional $355.68 fee for a third round of review.

#### 4. Repeat if needed

This process will be repeated until all comments have been addressed and your application is approved.

Most applications go through 2 rounds of review. After a second round of review, additional reviews incur a fee of $355.68.

### What happens after my application is approved?

When your application is approved, you or your hired professional will receive an email notification stating that your permit and approved plans are ready to be picked up at the Service Center at One Texas Center. Your permit must be posted somewhere visible on your work site, and then you may begin your project!

Remember, permitting doesn’t stop when you get started. Your work must be inspected throughout your process. Your permit will be closed after the final inspection.
