When you’re preparing to apply for your permit, keep in mind that your application is made up of the paper application as well as some attached documents that you will need to provide. The list of documents you will need depends on the specifics of your deck.

Remember, you can meet with one of our reviewers for a free 20-minute, in-person consultation as you prepare to apply, and they will let you know which documents your specific project requires. However, you will not submit your application in your consultation.

### What documents will I need?

All deck permits require:

#### 1. Application

* The [Uncovered deck permit application](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/pool_app_AWU.pdf) can be filled out by either you or your architect or engineer.
* The Covered deck permit application can be filled out by either you or your architect or engineer.

#### 2. Plot Plan

Your plot plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, a surveyor, or an expeditor. If you’re hand drawing the plot plan, use graph paper to make it simple to draw to scale. If applicable, include any power lines that run above your property.
