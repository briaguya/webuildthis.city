project_name: interior remodel
---


Before you start building or apply for a permit(s), it’s important to define your project, determine if you need any permits, and organize information you will need for your consultation and application. Let’s start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

### What is an interior remodel?

An interior remodel is the process of fixing or updating appearance or functionality within an existing home without adding or removing square footage to your home.

### Do I need a permit?

Depending on what you want to do, there is a spectrum of permits that your project can fall into: No permit, an express permit, an interior remodel permit or a new addition permit. You may also need to apply for a trade permit if you will be working with electric, plumbing or HVAC.

#### Not all cosmetic work requires a permit

There are certain home improvement projects that can be completed without needing a permit. You won’t need a permit or an inspection if you will only be:

* Replacing or switching out finishes or fixtures such as: flooring, tile, countertops, cabinets, painting walls, light fixtures, toilets or sinks,
* Removing less than 32 square feet sheetrock,
* Or adding non-metal roofing, such as shingles.

#### Express Permits

Small changes in your home are eligible for express permits. Applying for an express permit will help make sure it’s done safely. If your project does not go beyond any of the following, then you can get an express permit:

* Adding or removing siding on the outside of your home
* Adding or removing brick
* Adding or removing insulation
* Replacing windows with windows of the same size
* Replacing exterior doors with doors of the same size
* Repairing more than 32 square feet of drywall
* Removing drywall or insulation to evaluate or observe the home-structure
* Roof repair to the extent of replacing decking boards
* Foundation repair as long as it does not increase impervious cover
* Bathroom and kitchen remodels
  * Converting bathtubs and showers
  * Plumbing fixtures cannot be added or relocated
  * Walls cannot be relocated or removed
  * Only the drywall surrounding the bathtub, shower or sink can be removed

It’s important to remember that any smoke detectors and carbon monoxide alarms must meet code requirements, no matter what type of project you are doing.

#### Interior Remodel Project

An interior remodel only affects the inside of your home, with the exception of changing doors and windows. If your project includes at least one of the following, then you will need to apply for an interior remodel permit:

* Moving fixture locations,
* Moving an interior wall,
* Changing an exterior wall, such as adding a window or door, or changing a window size.

Your interior remodel may need a demolition permit, particularly if you are moving or changing an interior wall, or changing a window shape. Extra consideration will be taken when changing a load-bearing wall or support in your home.

#### New Addition Permit

New addition permits are required if you are changing the footprint of your home, either by expanding a room, or converting a garage into a living or sleeping space. Other examples include:

* Adding any square footage (air conditioned or un air conditioned) to your home,
* Converting inhabitable space into habitable space,
* Or moving an exterior wall.

As with interior remodel, you may need a demolition permit if you are tearing down an exterior wall. Another thing to note is that if your room has a window AC unit, the room is still considered airconditioned.

#### Trade Permits

Trade permits refer to what goes on behind the walls: electrical wiring, plumbing, and heating and cooling. Because the work is so specialized, you will need a trade permit if your project includes:

* Adding or moving an electrical outlet or fixture,
* Installing HVAC,
* Moving or adding a plumbing utility,
* Or installing a new hot water heater.

If you are installing or replacing your hot water heater, your contractor is responsible for getting the required permit for that project.

### Common Zoning Considerations for New Additions

Below are some terms that you may hear throughout this process, especially if you are applying for a new addition permit. Use this section to familiarize yourself with the terms. They will help make sense of the zoning regulations you need to follow to make sure your addition follows the City of Austin’s code. After you’ve made sure your project does not break any of the code regulations described below, you can find out how to get a permit.

#### Setbacks

If your project includes extending any rooms out into your yard, keep in mind that you cannot build within 10 feet of the rear border of your lot, or within 5 feet of the side borders of your lot.

#### Easements

If there is an easement on your lot, and you choose to extend a wall into that easement, you run the risk of being fined or having to demolish it if the city needs access to your easement.

#### Impervious Cover

If your project includes extending any rooms out into your yard, you will need to make sure you do not max out on your impervious cover limit. Impervious cover restrictions are in place to prevent flooding during and after heavy rains.

#### Floodplain

Before any construction can begin, you will need to determine if your home is in a floodplain because that may affect how much you can alter your home’s design. You can also do this by visiting [austintexas.gov/floodpro](austintexas.gov/floodpro). Enter your address and if your Flood Zone says, “Flood Zone: X,” then you DO NOT live in a floodplain.

### Getting a permit

#### How much do building permits cost?

The cost for permitting an interior remodeling project is X, depending on the specifics of your scope. This includes the plan review, the permit itself, your inspections, and fees.

There will be additional charges if your project requires a trade permit like an electrical or plumbing permit, you are building near a tree, or your home is in a historic neighborhood. Your reviewer can explain the costs during your in-person consultation.

#### Make sure you can get a permit

If your property currently has an [open or expired permit](/resources/can-i-get-a-permit/), you may not be able to get a new permit right away. Also, if you are expanding your footprint, and &nbsp;you have reached the maximum amount of impervious coverage, you may also be unable to get a permit at that moment. Instead, you will need to reconsider your project’s design.

##### Trees

If you have any trees over 19 inches in diameter, you will need to have your project reviewed by a city arborist. This is to make sure the Critical Root Zone is not damaged by any of the equipment as it is brought in to remodel your home.

##### You may need to hire a licensed professional

Depending on the specific plans for your remodeling or addition project, you may need to hire a licensed professional such as an engineer, architect or surveyor to complete certain parts of the application.

Find out which application materials may need to be prepared by a licensed professional in the Apply section or during your consultation

##### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work, and are responsible for getting any needed permits themselves. If you want to hire a contractor, it’s important that you work with a licensed contractor who will make sure this is done properly.

#### You may need a consultation to determine your project requirements

It is possible to prepare your permit application without consulting with a reviewer. However, many residents prefer to come in for a free 20-minute consultation with one of our reviewers before applying for their permit. During this consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

Give you personalized property information you will need to fill out your application. Depending on the information learned during your consultation, you may not be able to complete your remodel as you originally planned.

Give you a list of documents you need to prepare for your application based on your specific project.

Explain the next steps to apply for a permit.
