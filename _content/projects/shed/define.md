Before applying for a permit(s), it’s important to define your project, determine if you need any permits, and organize information you will need for your consultation and application. Let’s start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

### What is a shed?

A simple, enclosed structure that is physically detached from your house that no one will be living in and will be used primarily for storage.

Similar projects that have the same requirements as a shed include: Greenhouses, workshops, garages or carports, gazebos, and playhouses.

---

### Requirements for all sheds

Whether or not you need a permit, you still need to follow a few zoning regulations to make sure there are no future code issues with your shed. One way to make sure you will be able to easily address any future code issues is to purchase a pre-made shed that you can move if you need to.

#### Setbacks

If your shed will be less than 15 feet tall, then you must keep 5 feet from both your side and rear property lines clear. You may not build within these spaces. If you shed will be more than 15 feet tall, then you must keep 10 feet from your rear property line clear and 5 feet from your side property line clear, and you may not build within these spaces. There is also a 25 foot setback from your front property line.

#### Easements

When there is an easement on your lot and you choose to build on the easement, you run the risk of future fines or possible demolishment of your shed if the city needs to access your easement.

> ###### [What is an easement?](/resources/glossary/easement)

> {% include glossary-definition.html term="easement" %}

#### Impervious cover

If you do not live in a floodplain, your impervious cover cannot exceed 45% of your property. If you do live in a floodplain, your impervious cover cannot exceed 10% of your property. Impervious cover restrictions are in place to make sure a significant amount of water is making it back into the soil and to prevent flooding.

### Do I need a permit?

#### Building permits

Your shed will require a building permit if any of the following:

* It will exceed 1 story,
* Be over 200 square feet (for example, over 20 feet by 10 feet),
* Have plumbing,
* Have a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning unit (HVAC),
* Or be built in a floodplain.

> {% include glossary-definition.html term="floodplain" %} [Learn more](/resources/glossary/floodplain)

>
> ###### How do I find out if I'm in a floodplain?
>
> Using your address, check if your property is in a floodplain at [austintexas.gov/floodpro](http://austintexas.gov/floodpro/). If your Flood Zone says “Flood Zone: X,” then you DO NOT live in a floodplain.

#### Electric permits

Having electricity in your shed does not require a building permit, however you, if the property is your homestead, or your registered electrician must still get an stand-alone electric permit in person from the [Service Center at One Texas Center](/contact/)[.](__notset__)

* If your shed will require a building permit, the City will generate the electric permit with your building permit.

* If the electricity in your shed will require changes to the main electrical meter, a registered electrician must get the permit.

#### Tree permits

If your shed will require you to remove a tree (or perform construction within the critical root zone) that when measured 4.5 feet from the ground (diameter at breast height or DBH) is 19 inches or more in diameter (59.6904 inches around), then you will need a [Tree Ordinance Review Application](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/tree_permit.pdf). If your tree is 24 inches or more in diameter and a heritage tree, then you may not be able to remove it. [Learn more about protected trees and construction requirements](/resources/building-near-a-tree/).

### Getting a building permit

Permits are proof that changes on your property follow the City of Austin’s rules or are “up to code”, so you can be sure that whatever changes you make are safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors.

#### Make sure you can get a permit

If your property has any [open or expired permits](/resources/can-i-get-a-permit/) or is at its max impervious coverage, you may not be able to get a permit right away.

#### You may need a consultation to determine your shed requirements

While it is possible to prepare your application without consultation, we strongly advise you to come in for a free 20-minute consultation with one of our reviewers before preparing your application. At a consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

* Give you personalized property information you will need to fill out your application. Depending on the information learned during your consultation, you may not be able to build your uncovered shed as you originally planned.
* Answer any application questions,
* Provide you with a list of the documents you will need to prepare for your application based on your project,
* And explain the next steps in your process.

### Common shed considerations

#### You may need to hire a licensed professional

Depending on the specifics of your shed, you may need to hire a licensed professional such as an architect, engineer, surveyor, or tradesmen to complete some required application materials. Find out which application materials may need to be prepared by a professional in the Apply section or during your consultation.

#### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work and are responsible for getting any needed permits themselves with your written authorization. If you want to hire a contractor, it’s important that you select a contractor who will make sure this is done properly.

Check out our [tips for selecting a contractor](http://www.austintexas.gov/page/how-select-contractor).

#### Do prefabricated sheds require a permit?

A prefabricated shed may still require a permit. To determine if your prefabricated shed requires a permit, refer to “Do I need a permit?” If you're going to build or pour a foundation (such as pier and beam or slab) for a prefabricated shed and your shed will not otherwise need a building permit, you will not need a permit.

#### How much do building permits cost?

The cost for permitting a shed starts at $584.48, if your shed will be less than 1750 square feet in size. This includes the plan review, the permit itself, your inspections, and fees. If you will be building near a protected tree, need a trade permit, or will be building a shed greater than 1750 square feet, then there will be additional charges.

### Get a free 20-minute in-person consultation

In order to make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation, it’s helpful to prepare some information about your property and your project for your reviewer beforehand. This information will allow the reviewer to know what kinds of permits you may need based on what you want to do. The more information your reviewer is able to see before you apply, the more time it will save you during the application process. Keep in mind that the consultation is not where you officially submit your application for the permit, but it is a way to save you time and energy during the process. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet (coming soon).

#### 1. Collect the following information

* What is the address of where will you be building your shed?
* What will you be using this shed for?
* Decide whether your shed will:
  * Be over 1 story,
  * Be over 200 square feet (over 20 feet by 10 feet),
  * Be built in a floodplain,
  * Have plumbing,
  * Have a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning unit (HVAC),
  * And/or have electricity.

#### 2. Bring your Property Survey if possible

Your property survey, also known as a cadastral survey, isn’t required at consultation, but it will give the reviewer the best sense of whether or not you can move forward as planned. It gives them insight into such details as:

* Your setbacks: making sure you don’t build in your setbacks will prevent future complications with the placement of your shed.
* Your easements: being aware of any easements on your property will prevent any potential issues in the future with your deck.
* Your impervious cover: to help prevent flooding.

##### What if I can’t find my survey?

You likely received your survey when you purchased your home, if you purchased your home after 1980. If you didn’t or if you can’t locate it, try checking with your:

* Home lender or title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or, you can get a new survey. [Find a surveyor through the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](http://txls.texas.gov).

#### 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your shed and property

A sketch will give the reviewer a clearer picture of your project and help determine whether or not you can move forward as planned. You’ll want to bring two simple sketches to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to perfect drawings, but they should give enough information so the reviewer can tell:

##### a. Where your shed will be on your property

Sketch the layout of your property and be sure to show any existing structures (such as your house, pool, driveway, deck, etc.) and your shed. Including the estimated dimensions or square footage of these structures would also be helpful.

{% include lightbox-gallery.html diagram="plot-plan" do_caption="Make sure all markings are dark and clearly legible, draw lines and straight as possible, show new shed location on lot in relation to existing structures, have any measurements clearly labeled, draw and label any trees over 19 inches in diameter, and draw and label any concrete surfaces." dont_caption="Make sure you don&rsquo;t use any light-colored drawing utensils, draw crooked lines, leave out any existing structures, leave off any labels, or leave off any trees larger than 19 inches in diameter." %}

##### b. What your shed will look like

Sketch your proposed shed with its dimensions and any windows or doors.

{% include lightbox-gallery.html diagram="sketch" do_caption="Make sure all markings are dark and clearly legible, draw lines and straight as possible, have measurements clearly labeled, draw and label any windows or doors, and note the height." dont_caption="Make sure you don&rsquo;t leave off any labels of windows or doors, leave off any shed measurements." %}
