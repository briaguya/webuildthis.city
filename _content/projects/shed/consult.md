Get a free 20-minute in-person consultation

In order to make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation, it’s helpful to prepare some information about your property and your project for your reviewer beforehand. This information will allow the reviewer to know what kinds of permits you may need based on what you want to do. The more information your reviewer is able to see before you apply, the more time it will save you during the application process. Keep in mind that the consultation is not where you officially submit your application for the permit, but it is a way to save you time and energy during the process. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet (coming soon).

1. Collect the following information

What is the address of where will you be building your shed?

What will you be using this shed for?

Decide whether your shed will:

Be over 1 story,

Be over 200 square feet (over 20 feet by 10 feet),

Be built in a floodplain,

Have plumbing,

Have a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning unit (HVAC),

And/or have electricity.

2. Bring your Property Survey if possible

Your property survey, also known as a cadastral survey, isn’t required at consultation, but it will give the reviewer the best sense of whether or not you can move forward as planned. It gives them insight into such details as:

Your setbacks: making sure you don’t build in your setbacks will prevent future complications with the placement of your shed.

Your easements: being aware of any easements on your property will prevent any potential issues in the future with your deck.

Your impervious cover: to help prevent flooding.

What if I can’t find my survey?

You likely received your survey when you purchased your home, if you purchased your home after 1980. If you didn’t or if you can’t locate it, try checking with your:

Home lender or title company from your original purchase,

Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,

Or, you can get a new survey. Find a surveyor through the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying.

3. Draw a few simple sketches of your shed and property

A sketch will give the reviewer a clearer picture of your project and help determine whether or not you can move forward as planned. You’ll want to bring two simple sketches to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to perfect drawings, but they should give enough information so the reviewer can tell:

a. Where your shed will be on your property

Sketch the layout of your property and be sure to show any existing structures (such as your house, pool, driveway, deck, etc.) and your shed. Including the estimated dimensions or square footage of these structures would also be helpful.

{% include lightbox-gallery.html diagram="sketch-property" do_caption="Make sure all markings are dark and clearly legible, draw lines and straight as possible, show new shed location on lot in relation to existing structures, have any measurements clearly labeled, draw and label any trees over 19 inches in diameter, and draw and label any concrete surfaces." dont_caption="Make sure you don&rsquo;t use any light-colored drawing utensils, draw crooked lines, leave out any existing structures, leave off any labels, or leave off any trees larger than 19 inches in diameter." %}

b. What your shed will look like

Sketch your proposed shed with its dimensions and any windows or doors.

{% include lightbox-gallery.html diagram="sketch" do_caption="Make sure all markings are dark and clearly legible, draw lines and straight as possible, have measurements clearly labeled, draw and label any windows or doors, and note the height." dont_caption="Make sure you don&rsquo;t leave off any labels of windows or doors, leave off any shed measurements." %}
