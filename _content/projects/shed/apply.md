When you’re preparing to apply for your permit, keep in mind that your application is made up of the paper application as well as some attached documents that you will need to provide. The list of documents you will need depends on the specifics of your shed.

Remember, you can meet with one of our reviewers for a free 20-minute, in-person consultation as you prepare to apply, they will let you know which documents your specific project requires, and help you in filling out your application. However, you will not submit your application in your consultation.

### What documents will I need?

All shed building permit applications require:

#### 1. Application

The new construction/addition application is the appropriate application for a shed and can be filled out by either you or your architect, engineer, expeditor, or other designated representative.

#### 2. Plot plan

Your plot plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, a surveyor, or an expeditor. Note that for a shed, you can draw your shed to scale on your survey. It’s easier and helpful for reviewers!

{% include lightbox-gallery.html diagram="plot-plan" do_caption="Make sure all markings are dark and clearly legible, clearly note and draw to scale, make note of true north, draw straight lines, show new shed location on lot in relation to existing structures, draw and label all setbacks and easements, make note of multi-story structures, show the roof overhang with a dotted line, have all measurements clearly labeled, draw and label any trees over 19 inches in diameter, label any utilities, draw and label any concrete surfaces, label street name in front property, and put your address at the bottom." dont_caption="Make sure you don&rsquo;t use any light-colored drawing utensils, draw structures or plot not to scale, leave off the scale or north orientation, draw crooked lines, leave out any existing structures, leave off any labels, leave off overhang, leave off setback or easements, leave off your address or street, or leave off any trees larger than 19 inches in diameter." %}

#### 3. Floor plan or Structural Verification Report

Your floor plan of your proposed shed must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and can be prepared by you, your architect, engineer, or expeditor. For prefabricated sheds that require a building permit, a copy of the plans from the manufacturer along with a [Structural Verification Report](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf) from a licensed engineer or architect may be submitted in place of a floor plan.

{% include lightbox-gallery.html diagram="floor-plan" do_caption="Make sure all markings are dark and clearly legible, draw straight lines, clearly note and draw to scale, have measurements clearly labeled, draw and label any windows or doors, label wall and window thickness, and clearly label any utilities." dont_caption="Make sure you don&rsquo;t leave off any labels of windows or doors, leave off any shed measurements, leave out utilities, forget to include or draw to scale, or leave out wall and window thickness." %}

#### 4. Elevation plan

Your elevation plan of your proposed shed must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, or an expeditor. Note that for prefabricated sheds, plans from the manufacturer along with a [Structural Verification Report](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf) from a licensed engineer or architect may be submitted instead of an elevation plan.

{% include lightbox-gallery.html diagram="elevation-plan" do_caption="Make sure all markings are dark and clearly legible, draw straight lines, clearly note and draw to scale, have measurements clearly labeled, draw and label any windows or doors, label siding, show any overhang, show all four sides and clearly label any utilities." dont_caption="Make sure you don&rsquo;t leave off any labels of windows or doors, leave off any shed measurements, leave out utilities, forget to include or draw to scale, draw crooked lines, leave off the roof or show all four sides." %}

#### 5. Foundation plan

Your foundation plan for your proposed shed must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and must be prepared by a structural engineer. A foundation plan is required for all custom-built sheds. A foundation plan is also required for any types of foundations that require digging into the ground (excavating) or building a level surface (grading), such as a pier and beam foundation or a slab foundation. If you will be putting a prefabricated shed on a slab foundation, you will need a foundation plan.

#### 6. BSPA form

When applying for a building permit for a shed, a signed BSPA Form from [Austin Energy](/contact/) confirming your shed will not be too close to any power lines is required.

#### &nbsp;

#### Other commonly required documents

* **Owner’s Authorization Form****:** If one of your specialists, such as an engineer or an architect, is submitting your application, they will need your authorization to do so, and this form will be required. This form is only required if you are not signing the application.
* **Wind Bracing and Framing Plan:**&nbsp;If your shed will be over 500 square feet and custom build, you will need a wind bracing and framing plan drawn to IRC standards either by you, a structural engineer, an architect, or a certified building designer. Note that if you choose to draw this plan yourself, you will need to have a structural engineer complete a [Structural Verification Report](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf) for you.

### How do I submit my application?

Intake occurs at [Residential Plan Review](/contact/) at One Texas Center. You may:

* Sign up for intake in person at the QLess Kiosk at the Residential Plan Review Division
* Or you may save time by joining the line remotely on the [QLess website](https://kiosk.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/19062?queues=63813,65072,64852,64862,66812). After filling out your name and number on the website, you will need to select Residential-Permit Application Submittals. Then select New Application if this is the first time you’re submitting your application. If you’re submitting an update, then select update. You will be sent a text with your estimated service time, and you can follow the text prompts to receive status updates, leave the line, or get help.

#### What happens at intake?

You will meet with a staff member who will do a completeness check using this completeness checklist (coming soon).

Remember to leave ample time for this process. Residential Plan Review can get very busy and wait times can reach an hour or more. We recommend [signing up online](https://kiosk.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/19062?queues=63813,65072,64852,64862,66812) or arriving as close to opening time as possible to sign up in person.

Once you apply, you will be in the Review process. Reviewers will either approve your application or send your required changes in the form of comments. This process typically takes about 15 business days.
