The City of Austin has a strong interest in preserving the natural resources that make Austin the beautiful city that it is. So when starting a new project, you must consider any trees that may be affected by your work. This means protecting the larger trees and their roots.

## Protected tree sizes

Certain tree sizes are protected in Austin and require a special permit to cut down. You will need a [Tree Ordinance Review Application](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/tree_permit.pdf) if your project:

Involves a tree of any species that is 19 inches or more in diameter ( 59.6904 inches around),

And requires you to:

* Remove the tree,
* Or do work near the critical root zone.

To calculate a tree’s diameter, measure the circumference of the tree 4.5 feet above the ground (diameter at breast height or DBH), and divide by Pi (3.14). Trees smaller than 19 inches in diameter are not regulated.

## Digging into critical root zones

The critical root zone for a tree depends on the size of the tree itself. Larger, more established trees will have larger critical root zones that you will need to consider when building around trees.

Even if your completed project will not be within 10 feet of the tree, construction equipment may be brought in that could affect the health of the tree. For example, a large truck like a cement truck could damage the root system by driving over the roots that are just 4 inches under the ground.

To understand where you can and cannot build around trees, imagine that there are three impact zones of development to think about before you start your project. For this example, we’re using a tree with a 20 inch diameter.

> ##### How do I calculate the critical root zone?
>
> The critical root zone in feet is equal to the diameter of the tree in inches. For example, a tree with a diameter of 20 inches has a critical root zone of 20 feet.

### The Critical Root Zone

In this example, the critical root zone extends 20 feet from the base of the tree. You can dig into the ground in the outer half of the critical root zone (between 10 to 20 feet from the base of the tree or the green zone in this example).&nbsp;

#### ¼ Critical Root Zone&nbsp;

The ¼ critical root zone or the red zone in this example extends 5 feet (¼ of 20 feet) out from the base of the tree on the ground level. You cannot dig in this zone, because it will damage the trees roots.

#### ½ Critical Root Zone

The ½ critical root zone or the yellow zone in this example lies between 5 feet from the base of the tree and 10 feet from the base of the tree. You cannot dig in deeper than 4 inches into the soil in this zone.&nbsp;

## Heritage trees

Heritage trees are highly protected by the city of Austin in order to preserve the natural beauty of the city. If your tree is 24 inches or more in diameter and one of the following species, then navigating the critical root zone may be difficult due to its size and you may not be able to remove it:

* All Oaks
* Arizona Walnut
* American Elm
* Bald Cypress
* Bigtooth Maple
* Cedar Elm
* Eastern Black Walnut
* Pecan
* Texas Ash
* Texas Madrone

If the heritage tree is dead or it is a hazard to life or property, then you may be able to apply for a variance to have the heritage tree removed.

If you have a heritage tree in your yard, you will need to contact the [city arborists](/contact/#community-trees) about your project.&nbsp;

> Then it is not a heritage tree. If your tree is a heritage species and is between 19 and 24 inches in diameter, then it would fall under protected tree size regulations only.
