There are two things that can get in the way of you receiving a permit: an open or expired permit, maxing out on impervious cover, or both. If you have an expired permit, and it falls into the following permit types, you will need to get it resolved before you can move forward with your project:

> ###### [What is impervious cover?](/residential-toolkit/glossary/impervious-cover)
>
> {% include glossary-definition.html term="impervious cover"%}


* Building Permit (BP)
* Mechanical Permit (MP)
* Electrical Permit (EP)
* Plumbing Permit (PP)

## When does my permit expire?

Your permit will be open starting from the date your permit is issued and ending on the date of your final inspection. However, permits have a 180-day lifespan from the day they are issued or from the most recent in-progress inspection. If your project has not been inspected by day 181, or your permit has not been approved, then your permit is expired.

### How can I check for expired permits?

You can visit [Austin Build + Connect](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/public-search-other) to search for an expired permit.

## I have open or expired permits

There are two ways to resolve open or expired permits.

### 1. Re-permit the project with a new permit application

This is the best option if the old project will be impacted by the new project. For example, if you will be working on the same structure that has an expired permit, you will need a new permit. It is important to let the reviewer know you intend to resolve the expired permit under the “project description” of the new permit application.

### 2. Get a separate inspection

However, you may still need a separate inspection even if your old project won’t be impacted by the new work. If the new project does not impact the old project, or you want a separate inspection, you need to fill out two forms and include them with your new application:

* [Request for a Permit Extension, Withdrawal, or Reactivation](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Request_for_Permit_Extension__Withdrawal_or_Reactivation.pdf),
* And [Acknowledgement of Expired Permits](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/acknowlege_expired_permits.pdf) form.

Be sure to include the expired permit numbers and property address where necessary.

## What if I maxed out on impervious cover?

Some projects increase impervious cover like building a deck, a shed, or adding square footage to a current structure. If that sounds like your project, then you will need to schedule a free 20-minute in person consultation to review your options. They may be able to help you adjust your plans so that you meet the impervious cover limits.

If your project will not increase impervious cover, then your permit will most likely be approved.
