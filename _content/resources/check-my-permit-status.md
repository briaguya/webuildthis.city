If you have already submitted your permit application, it typically takes 15 business days for it to be reviewed. There are three ways to check your permit status:

* The public portal on [Austin Build + Connect](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/index),
* On the phone,
* Or by calling your reviewer.

## Check your permit status on Austin Build + Connect

You can check the current status of your permit by visiting [Austin Build + Connect](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/index). If you do not already have an Austin Build + Connect account, you must first create one. [insert sidebar: On the Austin Build + Connect homepage, select “Conduct business with City,” and then follow the prompt for a first time user. After creating your account, use the navigation located on the left hand side of the screen, and select “My Permits/Cases” from the menu.]

Follow the prompts to check the status of your permit.

Note that if you hired a professional such as a general contractor and they submitted your permit application, then they will be receiving your approval or any comments. You can request to be sent a copy of any emails if this is the case.

## Call your reviewer

The second way to check your permit’s status is to call the reviewer who initially reviewed your permit application, or met with you during the free 20-minute in-person consultation.

If you haven’t applied for a permit yet, make sure you can get one. If you have an open or expired permit, you will need to close it before moving forward with your project.
