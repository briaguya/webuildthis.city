Some projects are simple enough that they qualify for express permits.

### What is an express permit?

A residential express permit is issued when the scope of work does not change the footprint of the home, require demolition of walls, or require any electrical or plumbing work.

#### Can I get an express permit?

Small changes in your home can make a big difference, like replacing a drafty old window with one that is energy efficient. Applying for an express permit will help make sure it’s done safely.

If your project does not go beyond any of the following, then you can get an express permit:

* Adding or removing siding on the outside of your home
* Adding or removing brick
* Adding or removing insulation
* Replacing windows with windows of the same size
* Replacing exterior doors with doors of the same size
* Removing or repairing more than 32 square feet of drywall
* Removing drywall or insulation to evaluate or observe the home-structure
* Roof repair to the extent of replacing decking boards
* Foundation repair as long as it does not increase impervious cover
* Bathroom and kitchen remodels
  * Converting bathtubs and showers
  * Plumbing fixtures cannot be added or relocated
  * Walls cannot be relocated or removed
  * Only the drywall surrounding the bathtub, shower or sink can be removed

It’s important to remember that any smoke detectors and carbon monoxide alarms must meet code requirements, no matter what type of project you are doing.

#### How much does an express permit cost?

An express permit costs $6.50. However, there are some factors that could increase the cost.

If your home is more than 40 years old, your project may trigger a historic review. There are three different fees involved if that happens, which will cost $575.

Depending on the scope of your project, you will need a tree permit review and inspection if there are trees larger than 19 inches in diameter. The tree permit review and inspection costs $311. Even if you are only doing interior work, this inspection will make sure that the tree’s roots are not damaged by bringing in any equipment.

Finally, any subsequent updates to your plans will cost $105 to review.
