The City of Austin has a strong interest in preserving the natural resources that make Austin the beautiful city that it is. So when starting a new project, you must consider any trees that may be affected by your work. This means protecting the larger trees and their roots.

## Protected tree sizes

Certain tree sizes are protected in Austin and require a special permit to cut down. You will need a Tree Ordinance Review Application if your project:

* Requires you to remove a tree,
* Requires construction near the critical root zone,
* Involves a tree that is 4.5 feet from the ground or taller,
* Or involves a tree that is 19 inches or more in diameter (59.6904 inches around).

To calculate a tree’s diameter, measure the circumference of the tree at its widest point, usually at chest height, and divide by Pi (3.14). Trees smaller than 19 inches in diameter are not regulated.

## Digging into critical root zones

The critical root zone for a tree depends on the size of the tree itself. Larger, more established, trees will have larger critical root zones that you will need to consider when building around trees. Even if your completed project will not be within 10 feet of the tree, construction equipment may be brought in that could affect the health of the tree. For example, a large truck like a cement truck could damage the root system by driving over the roots that are just 4 inches under the ground.

To understand where you can and cannot build around trees, imagine that there are three impact zones of development to think about before you start your project. For this example, we’re using a tree with a 20 inch diameter.

### 1. ¼ Critical Root Zone&nbsp;

This first zone extends 5 feet out from the base of the tree on the ground level, and those roots make up a ¼ &nbsp;of the tree’s critical root zone. Your development cannot come within 5 feet of the tree or else it will damage the critical root zone.

### 2. ½ Critical Root Zone:

This second zone begins at 5 feet and extends 10 feet from the base of the tree and 4 inches into the ground. From 5 to 10 feet of the base of the tree you cannot dig in deeper than 4 inches into the soil.

### 3. The Critical Root Zone

This third zone begins 20 feet from the base of the tree. &nbsp;You are free to dig into the ground here, because the critical root zone has been preserved if you have taken care not to dig or damage the roots within 10 feet of the tree.

## Heritage trees

Heritage trees are protected by the city of Austin in order to preserve the natural beauty of the city. If your tree is 19 inches or more in diameter and one of the following species, then you may not be able to remove it:

* All Oaks
* Arizona Walnut
* American Elm
* Bald Cypress
* Bigtooth Maple
* Cedar Elm
* Eastern Black Walnut
* Pecan
* Texas Ash
* Texas Madrone

If the heritage tree is dead or it is a hazard to life or property, then you may be able to apply for a variance to have the heritage tree removed.
