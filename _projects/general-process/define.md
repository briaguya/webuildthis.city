Before applying for a permit(s), it’s important to define your project, figure out if you need any permits, and organize the information you need for your consultation and application.

## Introduction to permitting

Whether you change the layout of your home or add a new addition, most home-improvement projects require a permit from the city. Permits are needed to make sure any changes or additions are structurally sound, safe, and follow zoning regulations.

### Not all cosmetic work requires a permit

There are certain home improvement projects that can be completed without a permit. You don’t need a permit or an inspection if you only:

* Replace or switch out finishes or fixtures like flooring, tile, countertops, cabinets, painting walls, light fixtures, toilets or sinks,
* Remove less than 32 square feet of sheetrock,
* Or add non-metal roofing materials like shingles.

You will probably need a permit if your project requires more work that what’s on this list.

## Can I get a permit?

Whether or not you need a permit, you still need to follow a few zoning regulations to make sure your project doesn’t have any future code issues. Zoning regulations usually apply to exterior projects and exist for the safety of you and your family, guests, and neighbors. Zoning regulations are also kept in place to ensure that Austin’s beauty is protected for many generations.

### The most common zoning regulations are:

* Setbacks,
* Easements,
* Impervious Cover,
* Floodplains,
* And historic reviews for homes over 40 years old.

## Who can apply for a permit?

### You may need to hire a licensed professional

You may need to hire a licensed professional such as an engineer, architect, or surveyor to complete certain parts of the application depending on your project’s specific plans. If you’re building a new home or building onto your existing home, you will most likely need to hire a licensed professional.

Some parts of the Apply section of your application may need to be prepared by a licensed professional. The reviewer will tell you which application materials those will be during your consultation.

### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work and are responsible for getting any needed permits. It’s important that you hire and work with a licensed contractor who will make sure this is done properly.

You can apply for the permit without the help of a licensed professional if you are starting a smaller project such as building a fence or making other small changes.

## Common types of permits

### Building permits

Building permits are issued when you plan to construct, enlarge, demolish, improve, move, or repair a structure within the City’s zoning area. Many major home improvement projects require a building permit unless the changes are cosmetic and will not affect the original construction of your home.

### Trade permits

Trade permits are required if your project will involve any changes to electrical wiring, plumbing, or heating and cooling. Trade permits are needed because the work is specialized.

You will need a trade permit if your project includes:

* Adding or moving an electrical outlet or fixture,
* Installing HVAC,
* Moving or adding a plumbing utility,
* Or installing a new hot water heater.

Your contractor is responsible for getting the required permits if you are installing or replacing your hot water heater.

### Tree permits

The city protects certain trees in order to maintain Austin’s natural beauty. If you are working on the inside of your home, a tree review is necessary to make sure that any equipment brought in does not damage the critical root zone of any protected trees on your property.

### Demolition permits

Demolition permits are necessary if you change any walls in your home, extend a room past your home’s current footprint, or if you add any windows or doors. If you need a apply for a demolition permit, you will need:

* A survey or plot plan (you can use the same one used for your interior remodel or new addition application).
* To have it signed by the owner and notarized.
* Photographs of the area to be demolished. We recommend taking photos from several angles and taking more than you may think necessary.

### Express permits

Small changes, like converting a bathtub to shower or vice-versa, that don’t require moving plumbing fixtures in your home are eligible for express permits. Applying for an express permit will help make sure it’s done safely. [Figure out if your project qualifies for an express permit](/residential-toolkit/express-permit).

## You may need a consultation to determine your project requirements

It is possible to prepare your permit application without consulting with a reviewer. However, many residents prefer to come in for a free 20 minute consultation with one of our reviewers before applying for their permit. During this consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

* Give you the personalized property information you need to fill out your application. Depending on the information you learn during your consultation, you may not be able to complete your project as you originally planned.
* Give you a list of documents you need to prepare for your application based on your specific project.
* Explain the next steps to apply for a permit.
