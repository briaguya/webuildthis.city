title: Get a Consultation for a Permit in Austin
step_number: 2

To make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation with your reviewer, we suggest preparing some information about your property and project ahead of time. This information allows the reviewer to tell you what permits you will need to finish your project. Sharing information with your reviewer before you apply for a permit will save time.

Remember that you can't officially submit your permit application to the reviewer during the consultation. Having a consultation saves time and helps make the permitting process easier. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet and bring it with you when you meet with your reviewer.

### 1. Collect the following information:

Have the following information ready for your consultation:

* What is the address of the property you are working on?
* Will you move or demolish any interior or exterior walls?
* Will you need to replace or change your roof?
* Will you add to or remove any square footage from your home or property?
* Will you increase your home’s square footage by fifty percent or more?
* Will you demolish or change any existing property features such as a patio, a driveway, or a walkway?
* Will you change or add electrical wiring, plumbing, or a heating and cooling system?
* Will you make any cosmetic changes that would require an express permit?
* Do you have any on trees larger than 19 inches in diameter on your property?
* Is your home more than 40 years old?

### 2. If possible, bring your property survey

Your property survey, also called a cadastral survey, isn’t required at consultation but will let the reviewer know whether you can move forward as planned. Property surveys give them insight into details like:

* [Setbacks](/resources/glossary/setback): make sure you don’t build in your setbacks to avoid complications with where your project is located.
* [Easements](/resources/glossary/easement): be aware of any easements on your property to prevent future issues with your project.
* [Impervious cover](/resources/glossary/impervious-cover): to help prevent flooding.

#### What if I can’t find my survey?

You likely received your survey when you purchased your home, if you bought it after 1980. If you can't find it or don't remember getting it, try checking with your:

* Home lender or title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or a surveyor to get a new survey.
* Find a surveyor through the [Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](http://txls.texas.gov).

### 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your property or home interior

Sketches give reviewers a clear picture of your project and help them determine whether or not you can move forward with your project as planned. Please bring two simple sketches to your consultation:

* Sketch 1: The current layout of your property including any existing structures such as your house, pool, or driveway,
* Sketch 2: The layout of the structure you may be changing, adding, or removing.
