When you’re preparing to apply for your permit, keep in mind that your application is actually a packet made up of the paper application as well as some attached documents. The list of documents you will need depends on the specifics of your interior remodel project.

Remember, you can meet with one of our reviewers in their office for a free 20-minute, in-person consultation as you prepare to apply, and they will let you know which documents your specific project requires. However, you will not submit your application during your consultation.

### What Documents Will I Need?

#### 1. Application

The interior remodel application can be filled out by either you or your architect or engineer.

The new addition can be filled out by either you or your architect or engineer.

Demolition application if you are tearing down walls, or will be changing any windows or doors. The demolition application can be filled out by either you or your architect or engineer.

#### 2. Plot Plan

Your plot plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or by using a CAD program and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, a surveyor, or an expeditor. If you’re hand drawing the plot plan, use graph paper to make it simple to draw to scale. If applicable, include any power lines that run above your property.

#### 3. Floor Plan

Your floor plan of your proposed project must be drawn to scale either by hand or by using a CAD program and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, or an expeditor. If possible, use graph paper to make drawing to scale easy for you. We highly suggest you draw your floor plan on 3 pages, because if the reviewers can’t understand the drawings, your project will be reject.

Use a separate page for:

* The existing walls / features to be demolished,
* The existing walls / features to remain,
* And your proposed floor plan.

See Examples

#### 4. Elevation Plan

Your elevation plan of your proposed addition or extension must be drawn to scale either by hand or by using a CAD program and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, or an expeditor. Again, use graph paper if you’re hand drawing the elevation plan.

#### 5. Structural Drawings

The structural drawings refer to any bracing, framing or structural verification reports. You will need this if you are removing a load-bearing wall or changing any structural components. This should be completed by a licensed Texas engineer or architect.

#### 6. Foundation Plan

Your foundation plan must be drawn by a structural engineer.

#### Other Commonly Requested Documents

* **Owner’s Authorization Form**: If one of your specialists, such as an engineer or an architect, is submitting your application, they will need your authorization to do so, and this form will be required.
* **Certified Tax Certificate or Warranty Deed**: If you owe any taxes, you will have to pay those before a permit is approved.
* **Austin Water Utility Form**: Required if you are increasing the number or bathrooms or performing any work that will promote you to the next water meter size, such as moving from 3 to 3.5 bathrooms.
* **Homeowners authorization letter**: However, there is also a space for the homeowner’s signature on the application in lieu of letter.
* **S.M.A.R.T. Housing Project Information**: If you participate in S.M.A.R.T. housing, you will need to include a signed certification letter from Neighborhood Housing and Community Development (NHCD) and a signed conditional approval letter from Austin Energy Green Building.
* **Demolition Application**: This is only necessary if you will be changing any walls in your home, extending a room past the current footprint of your home, or adding any windows or doors. If you need a demolition application, you will also need:
  * A survey or plot plan (you can use the same one as your interior remodel or new addition application).
  * To have it signed by the owner and notarized.
  * Photographs of the area to be demolished, and we recommend taking photos from several angles, and taking more than you may think necessary.

### How Do I Submit My Application?

Intake occurs at Residential Plan Review at the One Texas Center. You may:

* Sign up for intake in person at the QLess Kiosk at the Residential Plan Review Division.
* Or you may save time by joining the line remotely on the QLess website. After filling out your name and number on the website, you will need to select Residential. Then select submissions. You will be sent a text with your estimated service time, and you can follow the text prompts to receive status updates, leave the line, or get help.

#### What Happens at Intake?

You will meet with a staff member who will do a completeness check using this completeness checklist.

Remember to leave ample time for this process. Residential Plan Review can get very busy and wait times can reach an hour or more. We recommend signing up online or arriving as close to opening time as possible to sign up in person.

Once you apply, you will be in the Review process, and the reviewers will have 15 business days from the day your application goes into the system to send you required changes in the form of comments.
