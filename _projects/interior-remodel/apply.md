## What Documents Will I Need?

### 1. Application

The interior remodel application can be filled out by you, an architect, or an engineer.

You'll need a demolition application if you are tearing down walls, or will need to change any windows or doors. The demolition application can be filled out by either you, an architect, or an engineer.

### 2. Plot Plan

Your plot plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or on a computer. The plot plan can be prepared by you, an architect or engineer, a surveyor, or an expeditor. If you’re hand drawing the plot plan, use graph paper to make it easy to draw to scale. If applicable, include any power lines that run above your property.

### 3. Floor Plan

Your project's floor plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or on a computer and can be prepared by you, an architect or engineer, or an expeditor. If possible, use graph paper to make drawing to scale easy for you. We strongly recommend drawing your floor plan on 3 pages to help reviewers understand your drawings. If the reviewers can’t understand the drawings, your project will be rejected.

Use a separate page for:

* Existing walls and features that will be demolished,
* Existing walls and features that will remain intact,
* Your proposed floor plan.

### 4. Elevation Plan

You don't need an elevation plan for an interior remodel.&nbsp;

### 5. Structural Drawings

You'll need structural drawings if you are removing a load-bearing wall or changing any structural components. Structural drawings refer to any bracing, framing or structural verification reports and should be completed by a licensed Texas engineer or architect.

### 6. Foundation Plan

Your foundation plan must be drawn by a structural engineer.

### Other Commonly Requested Documents

* **Owner’s Authorization Form**: You will need to give permission to any specialists, such as engineers or architects, if they are submitting your application. They also will need to use this form. This form is only required if you are not signing the application.
* **Certified Tax Certificate or Warranty Deed**: You need to pay any taxes you owe before your permit is approved.
* **Austin Water Utility Form**: This form is required if you are adding bathrooms or doing any work that will promote you to the next water meter size. An example of this can be increasing from 3 to 3.5 bathrooms.
* **Homeowners Authorization Letter**: There is a space for a homeowner’s signature on the application. You can choose to sign there instead of submitting a&nbsp;letter.
* **S.M.A.R.T. Housing Project Information**: You were likely told that your home was part of the S.M.A.R.T. Housing initiative when you purchased it. If you participate in S.M.A.R.T. housing, you will need to include both a signed certification letter from Neighborhood Housing and Community Development (NHCD) and a signed conditional approval letter from Austin Energy Green Building.&nbsp;
* **Demolition Application**: This application is only necessary if you change any walls in your home, extend a room past the current footprint of your home, or add any windows or doors. If you need a demolition application, you will also need:
  * A survey or plot plan that is signed by the owner and notarized (you can use the same plot plan as your interior remodel or new addition application).
  * Pictures of the area to be demolished. We recommend taking photos from several angles and taking more than you may think necessary.
