title: 'Get a Consultation for an Interior Remodel in Austin, Texas'
step_number: 2
project_name: interior remodel
---


To make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation, we suggest preparing some information about your property and your project for your reviewer beforehand. This information will allow the reviewer to know what kinds of permits you may need based on what you want to do. The more information your reviewer is able to see before you apply, the more time it will save you during the application process.

Keep in mind that the consultation is not where you officially submit your application for the permit, but it is a way to save you time and energy during the process. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet [Downloadable PDF].

## 1. Collect the following information:

For your interior remodel and new addition have answers for the following questions:

* Are you moving any interior walls?
* Are you adding or removing any square footage to or from your home?
* Do you have any [trees larger than 19 inches in diameter](/resources/building-near-a-tree/)?
* Are you demolishing any walls?
* Are you changing or adding electrical wiring, plumbing, or heating and cooling system?
* Is your home more than 40 years old?&nbsp;

## 2. Bring your property survey if possible

Your property survey, also known as a cadastral survey, isn’t required at consultation, but it will give the reviewer the best sense of whether or not you can move forward as planned. It gives them insight into such details as:

* Your setbacks: making sure you don’t build in your setbacks will avoid complications with the location of your project.
* Your easements: being aware of any easements on your property will prevent any potential issues in the future with your project.
* Your impervious cover: to help prevent flooding.

### What if I can’t find my survey?

If you purchased your home after 1980, you likely would have received your survey when you purchased your home. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember receiving it, check with your:

* Local property records or engineering department,
* Local tax assessor or local tax collector,
* Title or lending company from original purchase,
* Or, try asking your neighbors where they got theirs.

## 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your property or home interior

A sketch will give the reviewer a clearer picture of your project and help determine whether or not you can move forward as planned. You’ll want to bring three simple sketches of the floor plan, plot plan, or both to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to perfect drawings, but they should give enough information so the reviewer can tell:

* The current floor plan
* The proposed floor plan (including new windows or doors),
* The existing walls of your home,
* The proposed new walls,
* And, any walls you will be tearing down.

Sketch the layout of your property if doing a new addition, and be sure to show any existing structures like your home, a pool, a shed, your driveway, etc. If possible, including estimated square footage or dimensions will be helpful.

See examples of property sketches:

[Good Example / Bad Example]

Use a separate page for each sketch:

* What your interior currently looks like, including any windows and doors in the room
* And what your remodel project will look like, once completed.
  * Make sure your note any walls that will be partially or completely torn down, as well as any smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.

It’s especially important that you make note of any load-bearing walls or beams.
