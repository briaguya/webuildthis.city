title: 'Get a Consultation for an Interior Remodel in Austin, Texas'
step_number: 2
project_name: interior remodel
---


To make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation, we suggest preparing some information about your property and your project for your reviewer ahead of time. This information allows the reviewer to know what kinds of permits you need depending on what you want to do. The more information you give the reviewer before you apply, the more time you will save during the application process.

Keep in mind that the consultation is not where you officially submit the application for your permit. Consultations save you time and energy during the permitting process. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet [Downloadable PDF].

## 1. Collect the following information:

Make sure can answer the following questions regarding your interior remodel and new additions.

* Are you moving any interior walls?
* Are you adding to or removing any square footage from your home?
* Does your property have any [trees larger than 19 inches in diameter](/residential-toolkit/building-near-a-tree/)?
* Are you demolishing any walls?
* Are you changing or adding electrical wiring, plumbing, or a heating and cooling system?

## 2. Bring your property survey if possible

Your property survey, also called a cadastral survey, isn’t required during the consultation, but will show the reviewer whether or not you can move forward with your project as planned. Property surveys give reviewers insight into details like:

* Setbacks: make sure you don’t build in your setbacks to avoid complications with where you put your project.
* Easements: be aware of any easements on your property to prevent any future issues with your project.
* Impervious cover: helps prevent flooding.

### What if I can’t find my survey?

If you purchased your home after 1980, you probably received your survey when you purchased it. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember receiving it, check with your:

* Home lender or the title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or, you can get a new survey from a surveyor.

You can find a surveyor through the [The Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](http://txls.texas.gov).

## 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your property or home interior

Sketches give the reviewer a clearer picture of your project and help them determine if you can continue with your project as planned. Please bring three simple sketches of the floor plan, plot plan, or both to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to perfect drawings, but they should give enough information so the reviewer can see:

* The current floor plan
* The proposed floor plan (including new windows or doors),
* The existing walls of your home,
* The proposed new walls,
* And any walls you will tear down.

Use a separate page for each sketch:

* Sketch 1: What your interior currently looks like, including any windows and doors in the room.
* Sketch 2: What your remodel project will look like once it's completed.
  * Make sure you label smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and any walls that will be partially or completely torn down.

It’s especially important that you label any load-bearing walls or beams.
