title: 'Get a Consultation for an Interior Remodel in Austin, Texas'
step_number: 2

To make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation with your reviewer, we suggest preparing some information about your property and project ahead of time. This information will allow the reviewer to tell you what permits you will need to finish your project. Sharing information with your reviewer before you apply for a permit will save time.

Remember that you can't officially submit your permit application to the reviewer during the consultation. Having a consultation saves time and helps make the permitting process easier. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet and bring it with you when you meet with your reviewer.

* Are you demolishing any walls?
* Are you changing or adding electrical wiring, plumbing, or a heating and cooling system?

## 2. If possible, bring your property survey&nbsp;

Your property survey, also called a cadastral survey, isn’t required during the consultation, but will show the reviewer whether or not you can move forward with your project as planned. Property surveys give reviewers insight into details like:

* Setbacks: make sure you don’t build in your setbacks to avoid complications with the location of your project.
* Easements: be aware of any easements on your property to prevent any future issues with your project.
* Impervious cover: is regulated to help prevent flooding.

### What if I don't have my survey?

You probably received your survey when you purchased your home if you bought it after 1980. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember getting it, check with your:

* Home lender or the title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or, your surveyor to get a new survey.

You can find a surveyor through the [The Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](http://txls.texas.gov/education/).

## 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your property or home interior

Sketches give reviewers a clearer picture of your project and help them determine if you can continue with your project as planned. Please bring two simple sketches of the floor plan and plot plan to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to perfect drawings, but they should give the reviewer enough information so they can see:

* The current floor plan
* The proposed floor plan (including new windows or doors),
* The existing walls of your home,
* The proposed new walls,
* And any walls you will tear down.

Use a separate page for each sketch:

* Sketch 1: What your interior currently looks like, including any windows and doors in the room.
* Sketch 2: What your remodel project will look like when it's completed.
  * Make sure you label smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and any walls that will be partially or completely torn down.

It’s very important that you label any load-bearing walls or beams.
