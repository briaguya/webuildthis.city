step_number: 1
project_name: interior remodel
---


Before you start building or apply for a permit(s), you'll need to define your project, figure out if you need any permits, and organize the information you need for your consultation and application. Let’s start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

---

## What is an interior remodel?

An interior remodel fixes or updates the appearance or use of an existing home without adding or removing square footage.

---

## Do I need a permit?

Your project need specific permits depending on what you want to do. You may need an express permit, an interior remodel permit, a new addition permit, or no permit at all. You may also need to apply for a trade permit if you will change or install electric, plumbing, or HVAC.

You can change your project plan before you apply as long as it still meets the requirements for a simpler permit. If you can simplify your project enough, you may be able to change your project plan so that you don't need a permit.&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Not all cosmetic work requires a permit

There are certain home improvement projects that can be completed without a permit. You don’t need a permit or an inspection if you will:

* Replace finishes or fixtures such as flooring, tile, countertops, cabinets, painting walls, light fixtures, toilets or sinks,
* Remove or repair less than 32 square feet of drywall,
* Or add non-metal roofing, such as shingles.

### Express Permit

Small changes, like converting a bathtub to shower or vice-versa, that don't require moving plumbing fixtures in your home are eligible for express permits. Applying for an express permit will help make sure it’s done safely.

[Figure out if your project qualifies for an express permit](/residential-toolkit/express-permits/).

### Interior Remodel Permit

With the exception of changing doors and windows, an interior remodel only affects the inside of your home. you will need to apply for an interior remodel permit if your project includes at least one of the following:

* Moving electric or plumbing fixture locations,
* Moving an interior wall,
* Changing an exterior wall, such as adding a window or door, or changing a window size.

Examples of projects that qualify for an interior remodel permit include:

* Kitchen remodels,
* Bathroom remodels,
  * Removing drywall in bathrooms beyond what surrounds the bathtub or shower,
* Adding a window or door where one did not originally exist,
* Or making a window bigger.

Your interior remodel may need a demolition permit, especially if you will move or change an interior wall, or change a window's shape. Extra considerations are taken when making a change to your home's load-bearing walls or supports.

### New Addition Permit

While you may think your project is a remodel, the City of Austin may considered it as a new addition.

A new addition permit is required if you change your home's footprint by expanding a room, or if you convert a garage into a living or sleeping space. Other examples include:

* Adding square footage to your home, (air conditioned or un air conditioned)&nbsp;
* Converting inhabitable space into habitable space,
* Or moving an exterior wall.

You may need a demolition permit if you tear down an exterior wall.&nbsp;

If this sounds like your project, [schedule a consultation](/projects/interior-remodel/consult/) to review any zoning considerations that will affect your project.

### Trade Permits

You will need trade permits if your project involves changes to electrical wiring, plumbing, or your home's heating and cooling system. Trade permits are required for this type of specialized work.

You will need a trade permit if your project includes:

* Adding or moving an electrical outlet or fixture,
* Installing HVAC,
* Moving or adding a plumbing utility,
* Or installing a new hot water heater.

Your contractor is responsible for getting the required permits if you install or replace your hot water heater.

#### Tree Permit

If you have any trees over 19 inches in diameter, you will need to have your project reviewed by a city arborist. Even though there are likely not any trees inside your home, arborists make sure the tree's Critical Root Zone is not damaged by any equipment that is brought in to remodel your home.

## Getting a permit

### How much do building permits cost?

The cost for permitting an interior remodeling project starts at $200, and goes up depending on your project's specific needs. This includes the plan review, the permit itself, your inspections, and fees.

There will be additional charges if your project requires a trade permit, like an electrical or plumbing permit, if you are building near a tree, or if your home is in a historic neighborhood. Your reviewer can explain the costs during your in-person consultation.

### Make sure you can get a permit

If your property currently has an [open or expired permit](/residential-toolkit/can-i-get-a-permit/), you may not be able to get a new permit right away. You may also not be able to get a permit if you are expanding your home's footprint and have reached the maximum amount of impervious coverage. If this is the case, you will need to reconsider your project’s design.

## You may need to hire a licensed professional

Depending on the specific plans for your remodeling project, you may need to hire a licensed professional such as an engineer, architect, or surveyor to complete certain parts of the application.

During your consultation, find out which materials will need to be prepared by a licensed professional in the Apply section of your application.&nbsp;

### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work and are responsible for getting any needed permits. It’s important that you hire and work with a licensed contractor who will make sure this is done properly.

## You may need a consultation to determine your project requirements

You can prepare your permit application without consulting with a reviewer. However, many residents prefer to come in for a free 20 minute consultation with one of our reviewers before applying for their permit. During this consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

Give you personalized property information you need to fill out your application. Depending on the information you learn during your consultation, you may not be able to complete your remodel as you originally planned.

Give you a list of specific documents you need to turn in with your application based on your project needs.
