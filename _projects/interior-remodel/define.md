step_number: 1
project_name: interior remodel
---


Before you start building or apply for a permit(s), it’s important to define your project, determine if you need any permits, and organize information you will need for your consultation and application. Let’s start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

## What is an interior remodel?

An interior remodel is the process of fixing or updating appearance or functionality within an existing home without adding or removing square footage to your home.

---

## Do I need a permit?

Depending on what you want to do, there is a spectrum of permits that your project can fall into: No permit, an express permit, an interior remodel permit or a new addition permit. You may also need to apply for a trade permit if you will be working with electric, plumbing or HVAC.

You can change your project plan before you apply as long as it still meets the requirements for a simpler permit. You may also be able to change your project plan so that you don't need a permit, if you can simplify your project enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Not all cosmetic work requires a permit

There are certain home improvement projects that can be completed without needing a permit. You won’t need a permit or an inspection if you will only be:

* Replacing finishes or fixtures such as: flooring, tile, countertops, cabinets, painting walls, light fixtures, toilets or sinks,
* Removing or repairing less than 32 square feet of drywall,
* Or adding non-metal roofing, such as shingles.

### Express Permit

Small changes such as converting a bathtub to shower or vice-versa without moving any plumbing fixtures in your home are eligible for express permits. Applying for an express permit will help make sure it’s done safely.

[Figure out if your project qualifies for an express permit](/resources/express-permits/).

### Interior Remodel Permit

An interior remodel only affects the inside of your home, with the exception of changing doors and windows. If your project includes at least one of the following, then you will need to apply for an interior remodel permit:

* Moving fixture locations,
* Moving an interior wall,
* Changing an exterior wall, such as adding a window or door, or changing a window size.

Your interior remodel may need a demolition permit, particularly if you are moving or changing an interior wall, or changing a window shape. Extra consideration will be taken when changing a load-bearing wall or support in your home.

### New Addition Permit

While you may be thinking of your project as a remodel, it may actually be considered a new addition by the City of Austin.

A new addition permit is required if you are changing the footprint of your home, either by expanding a room, or converting a garage into a living or sleeping space. Other examples include:

* Adding any square footage (air conditioned or un air conditioned) to your home,
* Converting inhabitable space into habitable space,
* Or moving an exterior wall.

As with interior remodel, you may need a demolition permit if you are tearing down an exterior wall.&nbsp;

If this sounds like your project, [schedule a consultation](/projects/interior-remodel/consult/) to review any zoning consideration that will affect your project.

### Trade Permits

Trade permits refer to what goes on behind the walls. If your project will involve any changes to electrical wiring, plumbing, or heating and cooling, you will need a trade permit because the work is so specialized.

You will need a trade permit if your project includes:

* Adding or moving an electrical outlet or fixture,
* Installing HVAC,
* Moving or adding a plumbing utility,
* Or installing a new hot water heater.

If you are installing or replacing your hot water heater, your contractor is responsible for getting the required permit for that project.

#### Tree Permit

If you have any trees over 19 inches in diameter, you will need to have your project reviewed by a city arborist. This is to make sure the Critical Root Zone is not damaged by any of the equipment as it is brought in to remodel your home.

## Getting a permit

### How much do building permits cost?

The cost for permitting an interior remodeling project starts at $200, depending on the specifics of your scope. This includes the plan review, the permit itself, your inspections, and fees.

There will be additional charges if your project requires a trade permit like an electrical or plumbing permit, you are building near a tree, or your home is in a historic neighborhood. Your reviewer can explain the costs during your in-person consultation.

### Make sure you can get a permit

If your property currently has an [open or expired permit](/resources/can-i-get-a-permit/), you may not be able to get a new permit right away. Also, if you are expanding your footprint, and you have reached the maximum amount of impervious coverage, you may also be unable to get a permit at that moment. Instead, you will need to reconsider your project’s design.

## You may need to hire a licensed professional

Depending on the specific plans for your remodeling project, you may need to hire a licensed professional such as an engineer, architect or surveyor to complete certain parts of the application.

Find out which application materials may need to be prepared by a licensed professional in the Apply section or during your consultation

### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work, and are responsible for getting any needed permits themselves. If you want to hire a contractor, it’s important that you work with a licensed contractor who will make sure this is done properly.

## You may need a consultation to determine your project requirements

It is possible to prepare your permit application without consulting with a reviewer. However, many residents prefer to come in for a free 20-minute consultation with one of our reviewers before applying for their permit. During this consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

Give you personalized property information you will need to fill out your application. Depending on the information learned during your consultation, you may not be able to complete your remodel as you originally planned.

Give you a list of documents you need to prepare for your application based on your specific project.
