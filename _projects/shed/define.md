      If your shed will be less than 15 feet tall, then you must keep 5 feet from
      both your side and rear property lines clear. You may not build within
      these spaces. If you shed will be more than 15 feet tall, then you must
      keep 10 feet from your rear property line clear and 5 feet from your side
      property line clear, and you may not build within these spaces. There is
      also a 25 foot setback from your front property line. [Learn more about
      setbacks](/resources/glossary/setback).

      When there is an easement on your lot and you choose to build on the
      easement, you run the risk of future fines or possible demolishment of your
      shed if the city needs to access your easement. [Learn more about
      easements](/resources/glossary/easements).
  - tab_title: Impervious Cover
    tab_content_markdown: >
      If you do not live in a floodplain, your impervious cover cannot exceed 45%
      of your property. If you do live in a floodplain, your impervious cover
      cannot exceed 10% of your property. Impervious cover restrictions are in
      place to make sure a significant amount of water is making it back into the
      soil and to prevent flooding. [Learn more about impervious
      cover](/resources/glossary/impervious-cover).

Before applying for a permit(s), it’s important to define your project, determine if you need any permits, and organize information you will need for your consultation and application. Let’s start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

## What is a shed?

A simple, enclosed structure that is physically detached from your house that no one will be living in and will be used primarily for storage.

Similar projects that have the same requirements as a shed include: Greenhouses, workshops, garages or carports, gazebos, and playhouses.

## Requirements for all sheds

Whether or not you need a permit, you still need to follow a few zoning regulations to make sure there are no future code issues with your shed. One way to make sure you will be able to easily address any future code issues is to purchase a pre-made shed that you can move if you need to.

## Do I need a permit?

### Building permits

Your shed will require a building permit if any of the following:

* It will exceed 1 story,
* Be over 200 square feet (for example, over 20 feet by 10 feet),
* Have plumbing,
* Have a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning unit (HVAC),
* Or be built in a floodplain. To find out if you're in a floodplain, use your address at [austintexas.gov/floodpro](http://austintexas.gov/floodpro/). If your Flood Zone says “Flood Zone: X,” then you do not live in a floodplain.

### Electric permits

Having electricity in your shed requires an electric permit.

* If you want to run a line of electricity to your shed for a light or outlet, you will need to get a stand-alone electric permit in person from the [Service Center](/contact/#service-center) at One Texas Center.
* If the electricity in your shed will require changes to the main electrical meter, a registered electrician must get the permit.
* If your shed will require a building permit, the City will generate the electric permit automatically with your building permit.

### Tree permits

If you have any trees in your yard, you will first have to figure out their diameters. You can find the diameter of the tree by measuring the tree at 4.5 feet from the ground. But, not all trees grow straight up from the ground. Some grow on a slope, some trees lean to one side, and some branch out very near the ground. If that sounds like one of your trees, [use this diagram to measure your tree](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/City_Arborist/Tree_Measurement_Diagram.pdf).

If your tree measures 19 inches or more in diameter, then it is a protected tree and requires a [Tree Ordinance Review Application](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/tree_permit.pdf) before you can start construction. You will also need to pay the applicable fee.

If your tree is 19 inches or more in diameter and also a heritage tree, then you may not be able to remove it.

## Getting a building permit

Permits are proof that changes on your property follow the City of Austin’s rules or are “up to code”, so you can be sure that whatever changes you make are safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors.

### How much do building permits cost?

The cost for permitting a shed starts at $584.48, if your shed will be less than 1750 square feet in size. This includes the plan review, the permit itself, your inspections, and fees.

If you will be building near a protected tree, need a trade permit, or will be building a shed greater than 1750 square feet, then there will be additional charges.

### Do prefabricated sheds require a permit?

A prefabricated shed may still require a permit. To determine if your prefabricated shed requires a permit, refer to “Do I need a permit?” It’s also important to know that you do not need a permit to build or pour a foundation (such as pier and beam or concrete slab) for a prefabricated shed that otherwise doesn’t need a building permit.

### Make sure you can get a permit

If your property has any [open or expired permits](/residential-toolkit/can-i-get-a-permit/) or is at its max impervious coverage, you may not be able to get a permit right away.

## You may need to hire a licensed professional

Depending on the specifics of your shed, you may need to hire a licensed professional such as an architect, engineer, surveyor, or tradesmen to complete some required application materials. Find out which application materials may need to be prepared by a professional in the Apply section or during your consultation.

### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work and are responsible for getting any needed permits themselves with your written authorization. If you want to hire a contractor, it’s important that you select a contractor who will make sure this is done properly.

Check out our [tips for selecting a contractor](http://www.austintexas.gov/page/how-select-contractor).

## You may need a consultation to determine your shed requirements

While it is possible to prepare your application without consultation, we strongly advise you to come in for a free 20-minute consultation with one of our reviewers before preparing your application. At a consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

* Give you personalized property information you will need to fill out your application. Depending on the information learned during your consultation, you may not be able to build your uncovered shed as you originally planned.
* Answer any application questions,
* Provide you with a list of the documents you will need to prepare for your application based on your project,
* And explain the next steps in your process.
