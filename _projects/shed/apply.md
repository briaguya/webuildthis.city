When you’re preparing to apply for your permit, keep in mind that your application is made up of the paper application as well as some attached documents that you will need to provide. The list of documents you will need depends on the specifics of your shed.

Remember, you can meet with one of our reviewers for a free 20-minute, in-person consultation as you prepare to apply, they will let you know which documents your specific project requires, and help you in filling out your application. However, you will not submit your application in your consultation.

## What documents will I need?

All shed building permit applications require:

### 1. Application

The [new construction/addition application](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/new_con_addtn_app_AWU.pdf) is the appropriate application for a shed and can be filled out by either you or your architect, engineer, expeditor, or other designated representative.

### 2. Plot plan

Your plot plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, a surveyor, or an expeditor. If you’re hand drawing the plot plan, use graph paper to make it simple to draw to scale. If applicable, include any power lines that run above your property.

> Note that for a shed, you can draw your shed to scale on your survey. It’s easier and helpful for reviewers!

### 3. Floor plan or Structural Verification Report

Your floor plan of your proposed shed must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and can be prepared by you, your architect, engineer, or expeditor. If you’re hand drawing your floor plan, use graph paper to make drawing to scale easy.

For prefabricated sheds that require a building permit, a copy of the plans from the manufacturer along with a [Structural Verification Report](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf) from a licensed engineer or architect may be submitted in place of a floor plan.

### 4. Elevation plan

Your elevation plan of your proposed shed must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, or an expeditor. Note that for prefabricated sheds, plans from the manufacturer along with a [Structural Verification Report](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf) from a licensed engineer or architect may be submitted instead of an elevation plan.

### 5. Foundation plan

Your foundation plan for your proposed shed must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and must be prepared by a structural engineer. A foundation plan is required for all custom-built sheds. A foundation plan is also required for any types of foundations that require digging into the ground (excavating) or building a level surface (grading), such as a pier and beam foundation or a slab foundation. If you will be putting a prefabricated shed on a slab foundation, you will need a foundation plan.

### 6. BSPA form

When applying for a building permit for a shed, a signed [BSPA Form](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/bspa.pdf) from [Austin Energy](/contact/#austin-energy) confirming your shed will not be too close to any power lines is required.

### Other commonly required documents

* [**Owner’s Authorization Form**](https://www.aiaaustin.org/sites/default/files/coaownersletter-1.pdf)**:** If one of your specialists, such as an engineer or an architect, is submitting your application, they will need your authorization to do so, and this form will be required. This form is only required if you are not signing the application.
* **Wind Bracing and Framing Plan:** If your shed will be over 500 square feet and custom build, you will need a wind bracing and framing plan drawn to IRC standards either by you, a structural engineer, an architect, or a certified building designer. Note that if you choose to draw this plan yourself, you will need to have a structural engineer complete a [Structural Verification Report](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf) for you.

## How do I submit my application?

Intake occurs at [Residential Plan Review](/contact/#residential-plan-review) at One Texas Center. You may:

* Sign up for intake in person at the QLess Kiosk at the Residential Plan Review Division
* Or you may save time by joining the line remotely on the [QLess website](https://kiosk.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/19062?queues=63813,65072,64852,64862,66812). After filling out your name and number on the website, you will need to select Residential-Permit Application Submittals. Then select New Application if this is the first time you’re submitting your application. If you’re submitting an update, then select update. You will be sent a text with your estimated service time, and you can follow the text prompts to receive status updates, leave the line, or get help.

### What happens at intake?

You will meet with a staff member who will do a completeness check using this completeness checklist (coming soon).

Remember to leave ample time for this process. Residential Plan Review can get very busy and wait times can reach an hour or more. We recommend [signing up online](https://kiosk.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/19062?queues=63813,65072,64852,64862,66812) or arriving as close to opening time as possible to sign up in person.

Once you apply, you will be in the Review process. Reviewers will either approve your application or send your required changes in the form of comments. This process typically takes about 15 business days.
