title: Get a Consultation for a Shed Permit in Austin
step_number: 2
project_name: shed
---


All consultations take place at [Residential Plan Review](/contact/#residential-plan-review) at One Texas Center.

To make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation with your reviewer, we suggest preparing some information about your property and project ahead of time. This information will allow the reviewer to tell you what permits you will need to finish your project. Sharing information with your reviewer before you apply for a permit will save time.

Remember that you can't officially submit your permit application to the reviewer during the consultation. Having a consultation saves time and helps make the permitting process easier. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet and bring it with you when you meet with your reviewer.

## 1. Collect the following information:

---

* What is the address of where will build your shed?
* What will you use this shed for?
* Decide whether your shed will:
  * Be over 1 story,
  * Be over 200 square feet (over 20 feet by 10 feet),
  * Be built in a floodplain,
  * Have plumbing,
  * Have a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning unit (HVAC),
  * And/or have electricity.

## 2. Fill out the property and profile cards.

&nbsp;

## 3. If possible, bring your property survey.

Your property survey, also called a cadastral survey, isn’t required during the consultation, but will show the reviewer whether or not you can move forward with your project as planned. Property surveys give reviewers insight into details like:

* Your [setbacks](/residential-toolkit/glossary/setback): make sure you don’t build in your setbacks to avoid complications with your shed's location.
* Your [easements](/residential-toolkit/glossary/easement): be aware of any easements on your property to avoid potential issues with your shed.
* Your [impervious cover](/residential-toolkit/glossary/impervious-cover): regulated to help prevent flooding.

### What if I can’t find my survey?

You probably received your survey when you purchased your home if you bought it after 1980. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember getting it, check with your:

* Home lender or the title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or, your surveyor to get a new survey.

You can find a surveyor through the [The Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](http://txls.texas.gov/education/).

## 4. Draw a few simple sketches of your shed and property.

Sketches give reviewers a clear picture of your project and help them determine whether or not you can move forward as planned. Please bring two simple sketches to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to be perfect drawings, but they should give the reviewer enough information so they can tell:

### a. Where will the shed be on your property?

Sketch the layout of your property and show any existing structures including your home, pool, deck, driveway, etc. If possible, include estimated square footage or dimensions of the items on your property.

### b. What will your shed look like?

Sketch the shed you will build and include its dimensions and any windows or doors it will have.
