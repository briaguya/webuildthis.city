## What happens during the review process?

### 1. Approval or Comments

Reviewers will look through your application and check if your plans are in compliance with both the [IRC (International Residential Code)](https://www.iccsafe.org/codes-tech-support/codes/2015-i-codes/irc/) and the [LDC (Land Development Code)](https://www.municode.com/library/tx/austin/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT25LADE). Reviewers will either approve your application or attach comments in a Master Comment Report. This process takes about 15 business days.

You can check the status of your permit application on [Austin Build + Connect](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/index). To check your permit status, create an Austin Build + Connect account and select “My Permits/Cases” from the left side menu.

You can search for expired permits by selecting "Public Search." Enter the property's address, date range, or permit case/type and click on "submit."

If you are not the applicant and a hired professional submitted your application, the hired professional will receive the approval of your permit application and any review comments. If this is the case, you can request for copies of any emails be sent to you or your authorized applicant can forward them to you.

### 2. Your plans must be adjusted if you receive comments from reviewers.

A Master Comment Report that includes all reviewer comments will be sent to the email provided on your application.&nbsp;

Look up the [Municipal Code](https://www.municode.com/library/tx/austin/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=THCOAUTE01), refer to the&nbsp;[glossary](/residential-toolkit/glossary/), or speak with a professional if you need help understanding your comments.

If you have concerns or questions about specific comments, you can reach out to the reviewer who made them. Their information will be located in the comment document.

### 3. Submit updated plans

Follow the same process as your initial [application submission](http://alpha.webuildthis.city/projects/deck#how-do-i-submit-my-application?)&nbsp;to resubmit your updated plans.

After you resubmit, you will either get a&nbsp;notice that your plans have been approved or receive new comments.&nbsp;

### 4. Repeat if needed

You will continue to go though the same review process until you address all the comments on the report and your application is approved.

Most applications go through 2 rounds of review. If you receive comments a second time, you will need to pay an additional $355.68 fee for a third round of review.

## What happens after my application is approved?

When your application is approved, you or your hired professional will receive an email notification that says your permit and approved plans are ready to be picked up. You can pick up your permit and approved plans at the Service Center at One Texas Center. Remember to post your permit somewhere visible on your work site before you begin working on your project!

The permitting process doesn’t stop once you start working on your project. Your project must be inspected as you work on it. Your permit will be closed after you pass the final inspection.
