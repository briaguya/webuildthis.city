title: Get a Consultation for a Deck Permit in Austin
step_number: 2
project_name: deck
---


All consultations take place at [Residential Plan Review](/contact/#residential-plan-review)&nbsp;located at One Texas Center.

To make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation with your reviewer, we suggest preparing some information about your property and project ahead of time. This information will allow the reviewer to tell &nbsp;you what permits you will need to finish your project. Sharing information with your reviewer before you apply for a permit will save you time.

Remember that you can't officially submit your permit application to the reviewer or anytime during the consultation. Having a consultation saves you time and helps make the permitting process easier. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet and bring it with you when you meet with your reviewer.

## 1. Collect the following information:

* What is the address where you will build the deck?
* Is your deck:
  * Attached to your home?
  * Accessible by a door?
  * Smaller than 200 square feet?
  * Built on a floodplain?
  * 30 inches or more above ground?
  * Covered or uncovered?
  * Going to need electricity?
  * Near a tree greater than 19 inches in diameter?

## 2. If possible, bring your property survey

Your property survey, also called a cadastral survey, isn’t required during the consultation, but will show the reviewer whether or not you can move forward with your project as planned. Property surveys give reviewers insight into details like:

* Your setbacks: making sure you don’t build in your setbacks limits complications with the location of your deck.
* Your easements: being aware of any easements on your property will also help avoid complications with the location of your deck.
* Your impervious cover: impervious cover is regulated to help prevent flooding.

### What if I don't have my survey?

You probably received your survey when you purchased your home if you bought it after 1980. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember getting it, check with your:

* Home lender or the title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or, you can get a new survey from a surveyor.

You can find a surveyor through the [The Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](txls.texas.gov).

## 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your deck and your property

Sketches give reviewers a clear picture of your project and help them determine whether or not you can move forward with your project as planned. Please bring two simple sketches to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to be perfect drawings, but they should give the reviewer enough information so they can tell:

### a. Where the deck will be on your property

Sketch the layout of your property and show any existing structures including your home, pool, shed, driveway, etc. If possible, include estimated square footage or dimensions of the items on your property.

### b. What your deck will look like

Sketch your proposed deck and include its dimensions. Be sure to show it in relation to your home, where it will attach to your home (if it will), and any doors that will open onto the deck.
