title: Get a Consultation for a Deck Permit in Austin
step_number: 2
project_name: deck

---

All consultations take place at [Residential Plan Review](/contact/#residential-plan-review) at One Texas Center.

To make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation, we suggest preparing some information about your property and your project for your reviewer beforehand. This information will allow the reviewer to know what kinds of permits you may need based on what you want to do. The more information your reviewer is able to see before you apply, the more time it will save you during the application process.

Keep in mind that the consultation is not where you officially submit your application for the permit, but it is a way to save you time and energy during the process. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet.

## 1. Collect the following information:

* What is the address where you will be building the deck?
* Will your deck:
  * Be attached to your home?
  * Be accessed by a door?
  * Be smaller than 200 square feet?
  * Be built in a floodplain?
  * Be 30 inches or more above ground?
  * Be covered or uncovered?
  * Have electricity?
  * Be near a tree greater than 19 inches in diameter?

## 2. Bring your property survey if possible

Your property survey, also known as a cadastral survey, isn’t required at consultation, but it will give the reviewer the best sense of whether or not you can move forward as planned. It gives them insight into such details as:

* Your setbacks: making sure you don’t build in your setbacks will avoid complications with the location of your deck.
* Your easements: being aware of any easements on your property will also help you avoid complications with the location of your deck.
* Your impervious cover: impervious cover is regulated to help prevent flooding.

### What if I can’t find my survey?

If you purchased your home after 1980, you likely would have received your survey when you purchased your home. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember receiving it, check with your:

* Home lender or title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or, you can get a new survey.

Find a surveyor through the [The Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](txls.texas.gov).

## 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your deck and your property

A sketch will give the reviewer a clearer picture of your project and help determine whether or not you can move forward as planned. You’ll want to bring two simple sketches to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to be perfect drawings, but they should give enough information so the reviewer can tell:

### a. Where your deck will be on your property

Sketch the layout of your property, and be sure to show any existing structures like your home, a pool, a shed, your driveway, etc. If possible, including estimated square footage or dimensions will be helpful.

### b. What your deck will look like

Sketch your proposed deck with its dimensions. Be sure to show it in relation to your home, note where it will attach to your home (if at all), and any doors that will open onto the deck.
