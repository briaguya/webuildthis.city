Inspections are required during the process of building your permitted project and when the project is finished. Inspections make sure your work is safe and that your deck lasts a long time.

---

## What inspections will I need?

A list of required inspections specific to your project will be printed on the back of the permit you receive.

---

## Who can schedule inspections?

Anyone associated with the permit can schedule an inspection: the general contractor, the homeowner (if they are listed as the general contractor on the permit), the trade contractor, or their official agents.

---

## How do I schedule my inspections?

### Do I need to be home for my inspection?

You will be told whether you need to be home when you schedule your inspection.

If you don't need to be home during your inspection, make sure your permitted plans and permit are clearly posted for your inspector to see.

---

## What happens during inspection?

The inspector will go through checklists and check your work to make sure it follows the approved building plans. Inspectors also identify any improvements that need to be made to your project.

* [Framing checklist](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Residential_Inspection_Checklist_Framing.pdf).
* [Foundation checklist](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Residential_Inspection_Checklist_Foundation.pdf).
* [Layout checklist](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Residential_Inspection_Checklist_Layout.pdf).

Your inspector is available to answer any questions you have about meeting your requirements and building a safe and long-lasting deck.

## Final Inspection

Your project is complete once you pass your Final Inspection. Your inspector will email you your Certificate of Occupancy while they are on your property or when they return to their office. This means your permit is now closed and marked as complete in city records.

It is very important to close your permit(s). Permits that aren't closed may prevent you or people interested in buying your home from receiving permits on your property in the future. Learn more about [open and expired permits](/resources/can-i-get-a-permit/).

### What if I don't pass my final inspection?

Your inspector will let you know why you did not pass your final inspection. You may not have passed your inspection because:

* You didn't do everything you needed to in order to pass, like following the reviewer's comments,
* You did something that was not included in the plans.

You must make any needed changes and reschedule your final inspection before your permit expires.

Permits are only valid for 180 days. However, permits are extended for an additional 180 days each time you get an inspection and work is done on the project.

If the required changes take longer than 180 days to make, you may need to extend your permit in person at the [Service Center](/contact/#service-center) at the One Texas Center. You will need to fill out a Permit Extension/withdrawal/activation form. You can only get this type of extension one time.

Remember, you must pass your final inspection in order to close your permit(s).
