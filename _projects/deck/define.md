title: Define your Deck Project in Austin, Texas
step_number: 1
project_name: deck

---


Before you start building or apply for a permit(s), it’s important to define your project, determine if you need any permits, and organize information you will need for your consultation and application. Let’s start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

### What is a deck?

A deck is a platform-like structure without walls, often made of planks, that no one will be living on and is typically used for lounging or gathering.

### Requirements for all decks

Whether your project needs a permit or not, there are still a few zoning regulations you need to follow to make sure your deck follows the City of Austin’s code. After you've made sure your deck does not break any of the code regulations described below, you can find out if you need a permit.

#### Setbacks

No matter how tall your deck will be, you cannot build within 10 feet of the rear border of your lot, or within 5 feet of the side borders of your lot.

#### Easements

If there is an easement on your lot, and you choose to build a deck on that easement, you run the risk of being fined or having to demolish your deck if the city needs access to your easement.

#### Impervious Cover

Impervious cover restrictions are in place to prevent flooding during and after heavy rains.

> ###### [What is impervious cover?](/resources/glossary/impervious-cover)
>
> {% include glossary-definition.html term="impervious cover" %}

##### Uncovered Decks

If your uncovered deck has spaces between the deck boards and is located over a permeable surface like grass, then only half of the deck’s surface area will affect the total amount of impervious cover for your lot.

##### Covered Decks

If you are covering your deck or there won’t be spaces between the boards, then 100% of the deck’s surface area will count towards the amount of impervious cover on your lot. If you max out your impervious cover, a reviewer can assist you in changing your deck design.

### Do I need a permit?

#### Building Permits

Your deck requires a building permit if it will be or have any of the following:

* Be attached to your home,
* Be over 200 square feet (over 20 feet x 10 feet),
* Be more than 30 inches above ground,
* Have plumbing,
* Have electric,
* Or be built in a floodplain.

> ###### [What is a floodplain?](/resources/glossary/floodplain)
>
> {% include glossary-definition.html term="floodplain" %}
>
>
> ###### **How do I find out if I'm in a floodplain?**
>
> Using your address, check if your property is in a floodplain at [austintexas.gov/floodpro](http://austintexas.gov/floodpro/).
>
>
> If your Flood Zone says “Flood Zone: X,” then you DO NOT live in a floodplain.

#### Electric Permits

Having electricity on your deck does not require a building permit. However, you still need an electric permit.

* If your deck will require a building permit, the City will generate the electric permit automatically with your building permit.
* If you do not need a building permit but you want to run a line of electricity to your deck for an outlet or fan, you will need to get a stand-alone electric permit in person from the&nbsp;[Service Center](/contact/) at One Texas Center.
* If the electricity on your deck will require changes to the main electrical meter, a registered electrician must get the permit.

#### Tree Permits

If you have any trees in your yard, you will first have to figure out their diameters. You can find the diameter of the tree by measuring the tree at 4.5 feet from the ground. But, not all trees grow straight up from the ground. Some grow on a slope, some trees lean to one side, and some branch out very near the ground. If that sounds like one of your trees, [use this diagram to measure your tree](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/City_Arborist/Tree_Measurement_Diagram.pdf).

If your tree measures 19 inches or more in diameter, then it is a protected tree and requires a [Tree Ordinance Review Application](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/tree_permit.pdf) before you can start construction. You will also need to pay the applicable fee.

If your tree is 19 inches or more in diameter and also a heritage tree, then you may not be able to remove it.

Learn more about [protected trees and their construction requirements](/resources/building-near-a-tree/).

### Getting a building permit

Permits are proof that changes on your property follow the City of Austin’s rules or are “up to code,” so you can be sure that whatever changes you make are safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors. The same process for submitting a permit application applies whether your deck will be covered or uncovered.&nbsp;

#### How much do building permits cost?

The cost for permitting a deck starts at $584.48, depending on the specifics of your deck. This includes the plan review, the permit itself, your inspections, and fees.

If your project requires a trade permit like an electrical or plumbing permit, or you are building near a tree, there will be additional charges. Your reviewer can explain the costs during your consultation.

#### Make sure you can get a permit

If your property currently has an [open or expired permit](/resources/can-i-get-a-permit/), you may not be able to get a new permit right away. If you have reached the maximum amount of impervious coverage, you may also be unable to get a permit at that moment, and instead will have to reconsider deck materials or design.

#### You may need to hire a licensed professional

Depending on the specific plans for your deck, you may need to hire a licensed professional such as an engineer, architect or surveyor to complete certain parts of the application.

Find out which application materials may need to be prepared by a licensed professional in the Apply section or during a consultation.

##### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work, and are responsible for getting any needed permits themselves with your written authorization. If you want to hire a contractor, it’s important that you work with a licensed contractor who will make sure this is done properly.

Check out [our tips for selecting a contractor](http://www.austintexas.gov/page/how-select-contractor).

#### You may need a consultation to determine your deck requirements

It is possible to prepare your permit application without consulting with a reviewer. However, many residents prefer to come in for a free 20-minute consultation with one of our reviewers before applying for their permit. During this consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

* Give you personalized property information you will need to fill out your application. Depending on the information learned during your consultation, you may not be able to build your deck as you originally planned.
* Give you a list of documents you need to prepare for your application based on your specific project.
* Explain the next steps to apply for a deck permit.

### Make the most out of your consultation

All consultations take place at [Residential Plan Review](/contact/) at One Texas Center.

To make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation, we suggest preparing some information about your property and your project for your reviewer beforehand. This information will allow the reviewer to know what kinds of permits you may need based on what you want to do. The more information your reviewer is able to see before you apply, the more time it will save you during the application process.

Keep in mind that the consultation is not where you officially submit your application for the permit, but it is a way to save you time and energy during the process. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet.

#### 1. Collect the following information:

* What is the address where you will be building the deck?
* Will your deck:
  * Be attached to your home?
  * Be accessed by a door?
  * Be smaller than 200 square feet?
  * Be built in a floodplain?
  * Be 30 inches or more above ground?
  * Be covered or uncovered?
  * Have electricity?
  * Be near a tree greater than 19 inches in diameter?

#### 2. Bring your property survey if possible

Your property survey, also known as a cadastral survey, isn’t required at consultation, but it will give the reviewer the best sense of whether or not you can move forward as planned. It gives them insight into such details as:

* Your setbacks: making sure you don’t build in your setbacks will avoid complications with the location of your deck.
* Your easements: being aware of any easements on your property will also help you avoid complications with the location of your deck.
* Your impervious cover: impervious cover is regulated to help prevent flooding.

##### What if I can’t find my survey?

If you purchased your home after 1980, you likely would have received your survey when you purchased your home. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember receiving it, check with your:

* Home lender or title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or, you can get a new survey.

Find a surveyor through the [The Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](txls.texas.gov).

#### 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your deck and your property

A sketch will give the reviewer a clearer picture of your project and help determine whether or not you can move forward as planned. You’ll want to bring two simple sketches to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to be perfect drawings, but they should give enough information so the reviewer can tell:

##### a. Where your deck will be on your property

Sketch the layout of your property, and be sure to show any existing structures like your home, a pool, a shed, your driveway, etc. If possible, including estimated square footage or dimensions will be helpful.

![](/uploads/versions/shed-sketchproperty-good---x----1971-2503x---.jpg)**Do:***&nbsp;The sketch clearly shows labels, dimensions, existing structures, and the location of the proposed shed.*

![](/uploads/versions/shed-sketchproperty-bad---x----1278-1628x---.jpg)**Don't:***&nbsp;This sketch needs more detail—it should be drawn to scale, it needs dimensions, and setbacks need to be indicated.*

##### b. What your deck will look like

Sketch your proposed deck with its dimensions. Be sure to show it in relation to your home, note where it will attach to your home (if at all), and any doors that will open onto the deck.

![](/uploads/versions/shed-sketch-good---x----1099-673x---.jpg)**Do:***&nbsp;This sketch includes dimensions and clearly labeled windows, doors, and the landing.*

**Don't:***&nbsp;This sketch needs to include labels and dimensions.*
