## Define
{: .step}

Before you start building or apply for a permit(s), it’s important to define your project, determine if you need any permits, and organize information you will need for your consultation and application. Let’s start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

### What is a deck?

A deck is a platform-like structure without walls, often made of planks, that no one will be living on and is typically used for lounging.

### Requirements for all decks

Whether your need a permit or not, there are still a few zoning regulations you need to follow to make sure your deck follows the City of Austin’s code.

#### Setbacks

No matter how tall your deck will be, you cannot build within 10 feet of the rear border of your lot, or within 5 feet of the side borders of your lot.

#### Easements

If there is an easement on your lot, and you choose to build a deck on that easement, you run the risk of being fined or having to demolish your deck if the city needs access to your easement.

#### Impervious Cover

If your uncovered deck has drainage spaces between the deck boards and is located over a pervious surface, your deck should not cover more than 50% of the horizontal area. Impervious cover restrictions are in place to prevent flooding.

### Do I need a permit?

#### Building Permits

Your deck requires a building permit if it will:

* Be attached to your home,
* Be over 200 square feet (over 20 feet x 10 feet),
* Be more than 30 inches above ground,
* Have plumbing,
* Have electric, or
* Be built in a floodplain.

#### Electric Permits

Having electricity in your shed does not require a building permit, however you must still get an stand-alone electric permit in person from the Service Center at One Texas Center.

If your shed will require a building permit, the City will generate the electric permit with your building permit.

If the electricity in your shed will require changes to the main electrical meter, a registered electrician must get the permit.

#### Tree Permits

If your deck will require you to remove a tree (or perform construction near the critical root zone) that when measured 4.5 feet from the ground (diameter at breast height or DBH) is 19 inches or more in diameter (59.6904 inches around), then you will need a Tree Ordinance Review Application. If your tree is 19 inches or more in diameter and also a heritage tree, then you may not be able to remove it.

Learn more about protected trees and construction requirements.

### I need a building permit

Permits are proof that changes on your property follow the City of Austin’s rules or are “up to code,” so you can be sure that whatever changes you make are safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors.

#### Make sure you can get a permit

If your property currently has an [open or expired permit](/resources/can-i-get-a-permit/), you may not be able to get a new permit right away. If you have reached the maximum amount of impervious coverage, you may also be unable to get a permit right away.

#### You may need a consultation to determine your deck requirements

It is possible to prepare your permit application without consulting with a reviewer. However, many residents prefer to come in for a free 20-minute consultation with one of our reviewers before applying for their permit. During this consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

* Give you personalized property information you will need to fill out your application. Depending on the information learned during your consultation, you may not be able to build your deck as you originally planned.
* Send home a list of documents you need to prepare for your application based on your specific project.
* Explain the next steps to apply for a deck permit.

#### You may need to hire a licensed professional

Depending on the specific plans for your deck, you may need to hire a licensed professional such as an engineer, architect or surveyor to complete certain parts of the application.

Find out which application materials may need to be prepared by a licensed professional in the Apply section or during your consultation

##### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work, and are responsible for getting any needed permits themselves. If you want to hire a contractor, it’s important that you work with a licensed contractor who will make sure this is done properly.

Check out [our tips for selecting a contractor](http://www.austintexas.gov/page/how-select-contractor).

#### How much do building permits cost?

The cost for permitting a deck is $X. This includes the plan review, the permit itself, your inspections, and fees.

If your project requires an electrical permit or you are building near a tree, there will be additional charges. Your reviewer can explain the costs during your consultation.

### Make the most out of your consultation

To make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation, we suggest preparing some information about your property and your project for your reviewer beforehand. This information will allow the reviewer to know what kinds of permits you may need based on what you want to do. The more information your reviewer is able to see before you apply, the more time it will save you during the application process.

Keep in mind that the consultation is not where you officially submit your application for the permit, but it is a way to save you time and energy during the process. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet [Downloadable PDF].

#### 1. Collect the following information:

* What is the address where you will be building the deck?
* Will your deck:
  * Be attached to your home?
  * Be accessed by a door?
  * Be smaller than 200 square feet?
  * Be built in a floodplain?
  * Be 30 inches or more above ground?
  * Be covered or uncovered?
  * Have electricity?
  * Be near a tree greater than 19 inches in diameter?

#### 2. Bring your property survey if possible

Your property survey, also known as a cadastral survey, isn’t required at consultation, but it will give the reviewer the best sense of whether or not you can move forward as planned. It gives them insight into such details as:

* Your setbacks: making sure you don’t build in your setbacks will avoid complications with the location of your deck.
* Your easements: being aware of any easements on your property will prevent any potential issues in the future with your deck.
* Your impervious cover: to help prevent protect against flooding.

##### What if I can’t find my survey?

If you purchased your home after 1980, you likely would have received your survey when you purchased your home. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember receiving it, check with your:

* Local property records or engineering department,
* Local tax assessor or local tax collector,
* Title or lending company from original purchase,
* Or, try asking your neighbors where they got theirs.

#### 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your deck and your property

A sketch will give the reviewer a clearer picture of your project and help determine whether or not you can move forward as planned. You’ll want to bring two simple sketches to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to perfect drawings, but they should give enough information so the reviewer can tell:

##### a. Where your deck will be on your property

Sketch the layout of your property, and be sure to show any existing structures like your home, a pool, a shed, your driveway, etc. If possible, including estimated square footage or dimensions will be helpful.

See Examples: Good Example / Bad Example

##### b. What your deck will look like

Sketch your proposed deck with its dimensions. Be sure to show it in relation to your home, note where it will attach to your home (if at all), and any doors that will open onto the deck.

See Examples: Good Example / Bad Example

## Review
{: .step}

After submitting your application, you enter into the review process. During review, you and the city work together to make sure your plans are:

* Up to code,
* Safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors,
* And long-lasting.

### What is the review process?

#### 1. A set of reviewers will have 21 days to look through your application and either approve it or attach comments

You can check the status of your permit application on Austin Build + Connect. To check your permit status, you must create an Austin Build + Connect account and select “My Permits/Cases” from the left side menu.

Note that if you are not the applicant, meaning a hired professional submitted your application, the hired professional will be receiving your approval or any comments. You can request sent a copy of any emails if this is the case.

#### 2. If you receive comments, your plans must be adjusted

Comments are sent in a Microsoft Word document via email.

If you need help understanding your comments, reference the Municipal Code and glossary or speak with a professional.

If you have questions or concerns about your comments, you can reach out to the reviewer associated with the specific comments directly. This information will be located on your comment document.

#### 3. Submit updated plans

Resubmission is done through the same process as your initial application submission.

After you or your hired professional resubmit, you will receive either notice that your plans have been approved or you will receive new comments.

#### 4. This process will be repeated until all comments have been addressed and your application is approved.

Most applications go through 2 rounds of review.

### What happens after my application is approved?

When your application is approved, you or your hired professional will receive an email notification stating that your permit and approved plans are ready to be picked up at the Service Center at One Texas Center. Your permit must be posted somewhere visible on your work site, and then you may begin your project!

Remember, permitting doesn’t stop when you get started. Your work must be inspected throughout your process and when you’re finished in order to close any permits.

## Inspect
{: .step}

Inspections are required throughout your permitted project and when you’re finished to make sure all of your work is safe and sustainable.

### What inspections will I need?

When you receive your permit, a list of the required inspections for your project will be printed on the back of your permit.

### Who can schedule inspections?

Anyone associated with the permit can schedule an inspection: the general contractor, the homeowner (if listed as the general contractor on the permit), the trade contractor, or their official agents.

### How do I schedule my inspections?

Inspections can be scheduled one of three ways.

[need to insert tabbed options]

#### Do I need to be home for my inspection?

When you schedule your inspection, you will find out whether or not you need to be home. &nbsp;

If you are not required to be home during your inspection, you must clearly post your permitted plans and your permit for your inspector.

#### What happens during inspection?

Your inspector will inspect your work based on the approved building plans and their checklists and identify any needed improvements.

* Framing checklist.
* Foundation checklist.
* Layout checklist.

Your inspector is a great source of information to answer questions about meeting your requirements and building your shed safely and sustainably.

### Final Inspection

Your project is complete once you pass your Final Inspection. Your inspector will email you your Certificate of Occupancy either from their device while they are on your property or when they return to their office. This will close your permit marking your permit as complete in city records.

It is important to close your permit(s) because if you do not, it may prevent you or future homeowners from receiving permits on your property in the future. Learn more about open and expired permits.

#### What if I fail my final inspection?

Your reviewer will let you know why you did not pass. You must make any needed changes and reschedule your final inspection before your permit expires. Since permits are only valid for 180 days, you may need to extend your building permit to make the required changes before it expires. This can be done at the Service Center at the One Texas Center.

Remember, you must pass your final inspection in order to close your permit(s).
