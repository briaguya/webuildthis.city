## Define
{: .step}

Before applying for a permit(s), it’s important to define your project, determine if you need any permits, and organize some information you will need for your consultation and application. Let’s start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

### What is a shed?

A simple, enclosed structure that is physically detached from your house that no one will be living in and will be used for storage.

### Requirements for all sheds

Whether or not you need a permit, you still need to follow a few zoning regulations to make sure there are no future code issues with your shed. One way to ensure you won’t have code issues is to purchase a pre-made shed that is less than 200 square feet (less than 20 ft x 10 ft) that you can move if you need to.

#### Setbacks

If your shed will be more than 15 ft tall, you may not build within 5 ft of the side border of your lot or within 10 ft of the rear border of your lot. If your shed will be less than 15 ft tall, then you may not build within 5 ft from both the side and rear borders of your lot.

#### Easements

When there is an easement on your lot and you choose to build on the easement, you run the risk of future fines or possible demolishment of your shed if the city needs to access your easement.

#### Impervious cover

Typically, your impervious cover cannot exceed 40% of your property. Impervious cover restrictions are in place to prevent flooding.

#### Do I need a building permit?

Your shed requires a building permit if it will: \* Be habitable \* Over 1 story \* Over 200 square feet \* Built in a floodplain \* Have plumbing

One way to ensure you won’t have code issues, is to purchase a pre made shed that you can move if you need to.

### Yes, I do need a permit

Permits are proof that changes on your property follow the City of Austin’s rules or are “up to code”, so you can be sure that whatever changes you make are safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors.

1. Make sure you can get a permit.

2. You may need a consultation to determine your    shed requirements.

   While it is possible to prepare your application on your own, many residents prefer to come in for a consultation with one of our reviewers. At a consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

   * Speak to the specific requirements of your project such as your: easements, setbacks, and impervious cover; whether or not your property is in a floodplain; historic review; and zoning.

   * Be aware that based on this information, you may find in consultation that you cannot build your shed as planned.

   * Provide the necessary documents and a checklist

   * And explain the next steps in your process

Depending on the specifics of your shed, you may need to hire a licensed professional engineer to complete some required application materials.

### Prepare for your consultation

In order to make the most of your time in your consultation, it’s helpful to prepare some information about your property and your proposed project for your reviewer beforehand. This information will allow the reviewer to know what kinds of permits you may need based on your plans. Use the instructions below or print and complete this in-person preparation worksheet.

1. Bring your Property Survey if possible

   While your property survey, also known as a cadastral survey, isn’t required at consultation, it will give the reviewer a better sense of whether or not you can move forward as planned. It gives them insight into such details as:

   * Your impervious cover: impervious cover restrictions are in place to prevent flooding.
   * Your setbacks: ensuring you don’t build in your setbacks will prevent future complications with the placement of your shed.
   * Your easements: like setbacks, considering easements in the placement of your shed will prevent future issues.<!--  Unfortunately, you can't nest headings inside list items in markdown, so let's just bold this paragraph: -->

   **What if I can't find my survey?**

   You likely received your survey when you purchased your home, if you purchased your home after 1980. If you didn’t or if you can’t locate it, try checking with your: \* Local property records or engineering department \* Local tax assessor or tax collector \* Home lender or title company from your original purchase \* Or, try asking your neighbors where they got theirs. Remember, your survey is NOT required for consultation.

2. Take note of the following
   * What is the address of where will you be building your shed?
   * What will you be using this shed for?
   * Are there any other details in your design the reviewer may need to consider?
3. Sketch out your property and proposed shed

   A sketch will give the reviewer a clearer picture of your project and whether or not you can move forward as planned. You’ll want to bring two sketches to your consultation. \* A sketch of your property with all the existing structures (such as your house, pool, deck, driveway, etc.), your proposed shed where you envision building it, and the dimensions of all of these items including your lot. \* A sketch of your proposed shed with dimensions and square footage.

### How To Get A Consultation

Remember to leave ample time for this process. Residential Plan Review can get very busy and wait times can reach an hour or more. We recommend arriving as close to opening time as possible.
