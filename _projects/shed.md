## Define
{: .step}

Before applying for a permit(s), it’s important to define your project, determine if you need any permits, and organize some information you will need for your consultation and application. Let’s start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

### What is a shed?

A simple, enclosed structure that is physically detached from your house that no one will be living in and will be used for storage.

### Requirements for all sheds

Whether or not you need a permit, you still need to follow a few zoning regulations to make sure there are no future code issues with your shed. One way to ensure you won’t have code issues is to purchase a pre-made shed that is less than 200 square feet (less than 20 ft x 10 ft) that you can move if you need to.

#### Setbacks

If your shed will be more than 15 ft tall, you may not build within 5 ft of the side border of your lot or within 10 ft of the rear border of your lot. If your shed will be less than 15 ft tall, then you may not build within 5 ft from both the side and rear borders of your lot.

#### Easements

When there is an easement on your lot and you choose to build on the easement, you run the risk of future fines or possible demolishment of your shed if the city needs to access your easement.
