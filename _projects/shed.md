## Define
{: .step}

Before applying for a permit(s), it’s important to define your project, determine if you need any permits, and organize some information you will need for your consultation and application. Let’s start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

### What is a shed?

A simple, enclosed structure that is physically detached from your house that no one will be living in and will be used for storage.

### Requirements for all sheds

Whether or not you need a permit, you still need to follow a few zoning regulations to make sure there are no future code issues with your shed. One way to ensure you won’t have code issues is to purchase a pre-made shed that is less than 200 square feet (less than 20 ft x 10 ft) that you can move if you need to.

---

#### Setbacks

If your shed will be more than 15 ft tall, you may not build within 5 ft of the side border of your lot or within 10 ft of the rear border of your lot. If your shed will be less than 15 ft tall, then you may not build within 5 ft from both the side and rear borders of your lot.

#### Easements

When there is an easement on your lot and you choose to build on the easement, you run the risk of future fines or possible demolishment of your shed if the city needs to access your easement.

#### Impervious cover

Typically, your impervious cover cannot exceed 40% of your property. Impervious cover restrictions are in place to prevent flooding.

#### Do I need a building permit?

Your shed requires a building permit if it will: \* Be habitable \* Over 1 story \* Over 200 square feet \* Built in a floodplain \* Have plumbing

One way to ensure you won’t have code issues, is to purchase a pre made shed that you can move if you need to.

### Yes, I do need a permit

Permits are proof that changes on your property follow the City of Austin’s rules or are “up to code”, so you can be sure that whatever changes you make are safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors.

1. Make sure you can get a permit.

   [link text here](#linkurlhere)

2. You may need a consultation to determine your     shed requirements.

   While it is possible to prepare your application on your own, many residents prefer to come in for a consultation with one of our reviewers. At a consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

   * Speak to the specific requirements of your project such as your: easements, setbacks, and impervious cover; whether or not your property is in a floodplain; historic review; and zoning.

   * Be aware that based on this information, you may find in consultation that you cannot build your shed as planned.

   * Provide the necessary documents and a checklist

   * And explain the next steps in your process

Depending on the specifics of your shed, you may need to hire a licensed professional engineer to complete some required application materials.

### Prepare for your consultation

In order to make the most of your time in your consultation, it’s helpful to prepare some information about your property and your proposed project for your reviewer beforehand. This information will allow the reviewer to know what kinds of permits you may need based on your plans. Use the instructions below or print and complete this in-person preparation worksheet.

1. Bring your Property Survey if possible

   While your property survey, also known as a cadastral survey, isn’t required at consultation, it will give the reviewer a better sense of whether or not you can move forward as planned. It gives them insight into such details as:

   * Your impervious cover: impervious cover restrictions are in place to prevent flooding.
   * Your setbacks: ensuring you don’t build in your setbacks will prevent future complications with the placement of your shed.
   * Your easements: like setbacks, considering easements in the placement of your shed will prevent future issues.<!--  Unfortunately, you can't nest headings inside list items in markdown, so let's just bold this paragraph: -->

   **What if I can’t find my survey?**

   You likely received your survey when you purchased your home, if you purchased your home after 1980. If you didn’t or if you can’t locate it, try checking with your: \* Local property records or engineering department \* Local tax assessor or tax collector \* Home lender or title company from your original purchase \* Or, try asking your neighbors where they got theirs. Remember, your survey is NOT required for consultation.

2. Take note of the following
   * What is the address of where will you be building your shed?
   * What will you be using this shed for?
   * Are there any other details in your design the reviewer may need to consider?
3. Sketch out your property and proposed shed

   A sketch will give the reviewer a clearer picture of your project and whether or not you can move forward as planned. You’ll want to bring two sketches to your consultation. \* A sketch of your property with all the existing structures (such as your house, pool, deck, driveway, etc.), your proposed shed where you envision building it, and the dimensions of all of these items including your lot. \* A sketch of your proposed shed with dimensions and square footage.

### How To Get A Consultation

Remember to leave ample time for this process. Residential Plan Review can get very busy and wait times can reach an hour or more. We recommend arriving as close to opening time as possible.

## Apply
{: .step}

When you’re preparing to apply for your permit, keep in mind that your application is made up of the paper application as well as some attached documents. The list of documents you will need depends on the specifics of your shed.

Remember, you can meet with one of our reviewers for a free 20-minute, in-person consultation [INTERNAL ANCHOR LINK: Define&gt;Prepare for in-person consultation] as you prepare to apply, and they will let you know which documents your specific project requires. However, you will not submit your application in your consultation.

### What documents will I need?

All shed building permit applications require:

#### 1. Application

The new construction/addition application is the appropriate application for a shed and can be filled out by either you or your architect or engineer.

#### 2. Plot Plan

Your plot plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or by using a CAD program and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, a surveyor, or an expeditor.

See Examples

Good Example | Bad Example

#### 3. Floor Plan

Your floor plan of your proposed shed must be drawn to scale either by hand or by using a CAD program and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, or an expeditor.

See Examples

Good Example | Bad Example

#### 4. Elevation Plan

Your elevation plan of your proposed shed must be drawn to scale either by hand or by using a CAD program and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, or an expeditor.

Good Example | Bad Example

#### Other commonly required documents

* **Owner’s Authorization Form****:** If one of your specialists, such as an engineer or an architect, is submitting your application, they will need your authorization to do so, and this form will be required.
* **Foundation Plan:** If your shed will be over 200 square feet, a foundation plan must be drawn by a structural engineer.
* **Wind Bracing and Framing Plan:**&nbsp;If your shed will be over 500 square feet, you will need a wind bracing and framing plan drawn to IBC standards [Downloadable PDF] either by you or a structural engineer. Note that if you choose to draw this plan yourself, you will need to have a structural engineer complete a Structural Verification Report for you.

### How do I submit my application?

Intake occurs at [Residential Plan Review](/contact/) at the One Texas Center. You may:

Remember to leave ample time for this process. Residential Plan Review can get very busy and wait times can reach an hour or more. We recommend [signing up online](https://kiosk.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/19062?queues=63813,65072,64852,64862,66812) or arriving as close to opening time as possible to sign up in person.

Once you apply, you will be in the Review process [Internal link to Review: Shed section], and the reviewers will have 21 days from the day your application goes into the system to send you required changes in the form of comments.

## Review

After submitting your application, you enter into the review process. During review, you and the city work together to make sure your plans are:

* Up to code
* Safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors
* And sustainable

### What is the review process?

#### 1. A set of reviewers will have 21 days to look through your application and either approve it or attach comments

You can check the status of your permit application on [Austin Build + Connect](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/login?reset=true&amp;t_loginAgain=1). To check your permit status, you must create an Austin Build + Connect account and select “My Permits/Cases” from the left side menu.

Note that if you are not the applicant, meaning a hired professional submitted your application, the hired professional will be receiving your approval or any comments. You can request sent a copy of any emails if this is the case.

#### 2. If you receive comments, your plans must be adjusted

Comments are sent in a word document via email.

If you need help understanding your comments, reference the Municipal Code [External Link to code] and [glossary](/resources/glossary/).

If you have questions or concerns about your comments, you can reach out to the reviewer associated with the specific comments directly. This information will be located on your comment document.

#### 3. Submit updated plans

Resubmission is done through the same process as your initial application submission [Internal link to How do I submit my application?]

After you or your hired professional resubmit, you will receive either notice that your plans have been approved or you will receive new comments.

#### 4. This process will be repeated until all comments have been addressed and your application is approved

Most applications go through 2 rounds of review.

### What happens after my application is approved?

When your application is approved, you or your hired professional will receive an email notification stating that your permit and approved plans are ready to be picked up at the [Service Center](/contact/) at One Texas Center. Your permit must be posted somewhere visible on your work site, and then you may begin your project!

Remember, permitting doesn’t stop when you get started. Your work must be inspected throughout your process and when you’re finished in order to close any permits.

## Inspect

Inspections are required throughout your permitted project and when you’re finished to make sure all of your work is safe and sustainable.

### What inspections will I need?

When you receive your permit, a list of the required inspections for your project will be printed on the back of your permit.

### Who can schedule inspections?

Anyone associated with the permit can schedule an inspection: the general contractor, the homeowner (if listed as the general contractor on the permit), the trade contractor, or their official agents.

### How do I schedule my inspections?

Inspections can be scheduled one of three ways. [tab set]

### Do I need to be home for my inspection?

When you schedule your inspection, you will find out whether or not you need to be home. &nbsp;

If you are not required to be home during your inspection, you must clearly post your permitted plans and your permit for your inspector.

### What happens during inspection?

Your inspector will inspect your work based on the approved building plans and their checklists and identify any needed improvements.

* Framing checklist
* Foundation checklist
* Layout checklist

Your inspector is a great source of information to answer questions about meeting your requirements and building your shed safely and sustainably.

### Final Inspection

Your project is complete once you pass your Final Inspection. Your inspector will email you your Certificate of Occupancy either from their device while they are on your property or when they return to their office. This will close your permit marking your permit as complete in city records.

It is important to close your permit(s) because if you do not, it may prevent you or future homeowners from receiving permits on your property in the future. Learn more about [open and expired permits](/resources/can-i-get-a-permit/).

#### What if I fail my final inspection?

Your reviewer will let you know why you did not pass. You must make any needed changes and reschedule your final inspection before your permit expires. Since permits are only valid for 180 days, you may need to extend your building permit to make the required changes before it expires. This can be done at the [Service Center](/contact/) at the One Texas Center.

Remember, you must pass your final inspection in order to close your permit(s).
