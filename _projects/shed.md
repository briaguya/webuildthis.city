## Define
{: .step}

Before applying for a permit(s), it’s important to define your project, determine if you need any permits, and organize information you will need for your consultation and application. Let’s start by making sure your definition of your project is the same as the City of Austin’s definition.

---

### What is a shed?

A simple, enclosed structure that is physically detached from your house that no one will be living in and will be used primarily for storage.

Similar projects that have the same requirements as a shed include: Greenhouses, workshops, garages or carports, gazebos, and playhouses.

---

### Requirements for all sheds

Whether or not you need a permit, you still need to follow a few zoning regulations to make sure there are no future code issues with your shed. One way to make sure you will be able to easily address any future code issues is to purchase a pre-made shed that you can move if you need to.

#### Setbacks

If your shed will be less than 15 feet tall, then you must keep 5 feet from both your side and rear property lines clear. You may not build within these spaces. If you shed will be more than 15 feet tall, then you must keep 10 feet from your rear property line clear and 5 feet from your side property line clear, and you may not build within these spaces. There is also a 25 foot setback from your front property line.
{: .insert-glossary-here}

<aside class="glossary-aside"><h6 class="glossary-title"><a href="/glossary/setback">Setback Definition </a></h6>The space between the border of a lot and the buildable area. That space typically cannot have anything built on it.</aside>

#### Easements

When there is an easement on your lot and you choose to build on the easement, you run the risk of future fines or possible demolishment of your shed if the city needs to access your easement.
{: .insert-glossary-here}

<aside class="glossary-aside"><h6 class="glossary-title"><a href="/glossary/easement">Easement Definition </a></h6>An area of a resident's land that may be used by a government entity or neighbor. If there is an easement on your land, you may not build on it.</aside>

#### Impervious cover

If you do not live in a floodplain, your impervious cover cannot exceed 45% of your property. If you do live in a floodplain, your impervious cover cannot exceed 10% of your property. Impervious cover restrictions are in place to make sure a significant amount of water is making it back into the soil and to prevent flooding.
{: .insert-glossary-here}

<aside class="glossary-aside"><h6 class="glossary-title"><a href="/glossary/impervious-cover"> Definition </a></h6></aside>

---

### Do I need a permit?

#### Building permits

Your shed requires a building permit if any of the following:

* Exceed 1 story,
* Be over 200 square feet (for example, over 20 feet by 10 feet),
* Be built in a floodplain,
* Have plumbing,
* Have Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning unit (HVAC).

#### Electric permits

Having electricity in your shed does not require a building permit, however you, if the property is your homestead, or your registered electrician must still get an stand-alone electric permit in person from the [Service Center at One Texas Center](/contact/).

* If your shed will require a building permit, the City will generate the electric permit with your building permit.

* If the electricity in your shed will require changes to the main electrical meter, a registered electrician must get the permit.

#### Tree permits

If your shed will require you to remove a tree (or perform construction within the critical root zone) that when measured 4.5 feet from the ground (diameter at breast height or DBH) is 19 inches or more in diameter (59.6904 inches around), then you will need a [Tree Ordinance Review Application](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/tree_permit.pdf). If your tree is 30 inches or more in diameter and a heritage tree, then you may not be able to remove it. [Learn more about protected trees and construction requirements](/resources/building-near-a-tree/).

---

### Getting a building permit

Permits are proof that changes on your property follow the City of Austin’s rules or are “up to code”, so you can be sure that whatever changes you make are safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors.

#### Make sure you can get a permit

If your property has any [open or expired permits](/resources/can-i-get-a-permit/) or is at its max impervious coverage, you may not be able to get a permit right away.

#### You may need a consultation to determine your shed requirements

While it is possible to prepare your application without consultation, we strongly advise you to come in for a free 20-minute consultation with one of our reviewers before preparing your application. At a consultation, the reviewer will be able to:

* Give you personalized property information you will need to fill out your application. Depending on the information learned during your consultation, you may not be able to build your uncovered shed as you originally planned.
* Answer any application questions,
* Provide you with a list of the documents you will need to prepare for your application based on your project,
* And explain the next steps in your process.

---

### Common shed considerations

#### You may need to hire a licensed professional

Depending on the specifics of your shed, you may need to hire a licensed professional such as an architect, engineer, surveyor, or tradesmen to complete some required application materials. Find out which application materials may need to be prepared by a professional in the Apply section or during your consultation.

#### What if I want to hire a contractor?

Contractors are required to get permits for their work and are responsible for getting any needed permits themselves with your written authorization. If you want to hire a contractor, it’s important that you select a contractor who will make sure this is done properly.

Check out our [tips for selecting a contractor](http://www.austintexas.gov/page/how-select-contractor).

#### Do prefabricated sheds require a permit?

A prefabricated shed may still require a permit. To determine if your prefabricated shed requires a permit, refer to “Do I need a permit?”

#### How much do building permits cost?

The cost for permitting a shed starts at $584.48, if your shed will be less than 1750 square feet in size. This includes the plan review, the permit itself, your inspections, and fees. If you will be building near a protected tree, need a trade permit, or will be building a shed greater than 1750 square feet, then there will be additional charges.

---

### Get a free 20-minute in-person consultation

In order to make the most of your free 20 minute in-person consultation, it’s helpful to prepare some information about your property and your project for your reviewer beforehand. This information will allow the reviewer to know what kinds of permits you may need based on what you want to do. The more information your reviewer is able to see before you apply, the more time it will save you during the application process. Keep in mind that the consultation is not where you officially submit your application for the permit, but it is a way to save you time and energy during the process. Use the instructions below or print and complete this consultation prep worksheet (coming soon).

#### 1. Collect the following information

* What is the address of where will you be building your shed?
* What will you be using this shed for?
* Decide whether your shed will:
  * Be over 1 story,
  * Be over 200 square feet (over 20 feet by 10 feet),
  * Be built in a floodplain,
  * Have plumbing,
  * Have a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning unit (HVAC),
  * And/or have electricity.

#### 2. Bring your Property Survey if possible

Your property survey, also known as a cadastral survey, isn’t required at consultation, but it will give the reviewer the best sense of whether or not you can move forward as planned. It gives them insight into such details as:

* Your setbacks: making sure you don’t build in your setbacks will prevent future complications with the placement of your shed.
* Your easements: being aware of any easements on your property will prevent any potential issues in the future with your deck.
* Your impervious cover: to help prevent flooding.

##### What if I can't find my survey?

You likely received your survey when you purchased your home, if you purchased your home after 1980. If you didn’t or if you can’t locate it, try checking with your:

* Home lender or title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or, you can get a new survey. [Find a surveyor through the Texas Board of Professional Land Surveying](http://txls.texas.gov).

#### 3. Draw a few simple sketches of your shed and property

A sketch will give the reviewer a clearer picture of your project and help determine whether or not you can move forward as planned. You’ll want to bring two simple sketches to your consultation. These sketches don’t have to perfect drawings, but they should give enough information so the reviewer can tell:

##### a. Where your shed will be on your property

Sketch the layout of your property and be sure to show any existing structures (such as your house, pool, driveway, deck, etc.) and your shed. Including the estimated dimensions or square footage of these structures would also be helpful.

See Examples

After your consultation, feel free to return to the next section for further assistance on preparing your application.

## Apply
{: .step}

When you’re preparing to apply for your permit, keep in mind that your application is made up of the paper application as well as some attached documents that you will need to provide. The list of documents you will need depends on the specifics of your shed.

Remember, you can meet with one of our reviewers for a free 20-minute, in-person consultation as you prepare to apply, they will let you know which documents your specific project requires, and help you in filling out your application. However, you will not submit your application in your consultation.

---

### What documents will I need?

All shed building permit applications require:

#### 1. Application

The new construction/addition application is the appropriate application for a shed and can be filled out by either you or your architect, engineer, expeditor, or other designated representative.

#### 2. Plot plan

Your plot plan must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, a surveyor, or an expeditor. Note that for a shed, you can draw your shed to scale on your survey. It's easier and helpful for reviewers!

See Examples

| Good Example | Bad Example |

#### 3. Floor plan or Structural Verification Report

Your floor plan of your proposed shed must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and can be prepared by you, your architect, engineer, or expeditor. For prefabricated sheds that require a building permit, a copy of the plans from the manufacturer along with a [Structural Verification Report](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf) from a licensed engineer or architect may be submitted in place of a floor plan.

See Examples

| Good Example | Bad Example |

#### 4. Elevation plan

Your elevation plan of your proposed shed must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and can be prepared by you, your architect or engineer, or an expeditor. Note that for prefabricated sheds, plans from the manufacturer along with a [Structural Verification Report](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf) from a licensed engineer or architect may be submitted instead of an elevation plan.

See Examples

| Good Example | Bad Example |

#### 5. Foundation plan

Your foundation plan for your proposed shed must be drawn to scale either by hand or on the computer and must be prepared by a structural engineer. A foundation plan is required for all custom-built sheds. A foundation plan is also required for any types of foundations that require digging into the ground (excavating) or building a level surface (grading), such as a pier and beam foundation or a slab foundation. If you will be putting a prefabricated shed on a slab foundation, you will need a foundation plan.

#### 6. BSPA form

When applying for a building permit for a shed, a signed BSPA Form from [Austin Energy](/contact/) confirming your shed will not be too close to any power lines is required.

#### &nbsp;

#### Other commonly required documents

* **Owner’s Authorization Form****:** If one of your specialists, such as an engineer or an architect, is submitting your application, they will need your authorization to do so, and this form will be required. This form is only required if you are not signing the application.
* **Wind Bracing and Framing Plan:**&nbsp;If your shed will be over 500 square feet and custom build, you will need a wind bracing and framing plan drawn to IRC standards either by you, a structural engineer, an architect, or a certified building designer. Note that if you choose to draw this plan yourself, you will need to have a structural engineer complete a [Structural Verification Report](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Applications_Forms/Structural_Verification_Report_citylogo.pdf) for you.

---

### How do I submit my application?

Intake occurs at [Residential Plan Review](/contact/) at One Texas Center. You may:

* Sign up for intake in person at the QLess Kiosk at the Residential Plan Review Division
* Or you may save time by joining the line remotely on the [QLess website](https://kiosk.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/19062?queues=63813,65072,64852,64862,66812). After filling out your name and number on the website, you will need to select Residential-Permit Application Submittals. Then select New Application if this is the first time you’re submitting your application. If you’re submitting an update, then select update. You will be sent a text with your estimated service time, and you can follow the text prompts to receive status updates, leave the line, or get help.

#### What happens at intake?

You will meet with a staff member who will do a completeness check using this completeness checklist (coming soon).

Remember to leave ample time for this process. Residential Plan Review can get very busy and wait times can reach an hour or more. We recommend [signing up online](https://kiosk.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/19062?queues=63813,65072,64852,64862,66812) or arriving as close to opening time as possible to sign up in person.

Once you apply, you will be in the Review process. Reviewers will either approve your application or send your required changes in the form of comments. This process typically takes about 15 business days.

## Review
{: .step}

After submitting your application and paying your invoice, you enter into the review process. During review, you and the city work together to make sure your plans are:

* Up to code,
* Safe for you, your guests, and your neighbors,
* And long-lasting.

---

### What is the review process?

#### 1. A set of reviewers will take about 15 business days to look through your application and either approve it or attach comments in a Master Comment Report

Reviewers will be checking your plans for compliance against both the [IRC (International Residential Code)](https://www.iccsafe.org/codes-tech-support/codes/2015-i-codes/irc/) and the [LDC (Land Development Code)](https://www.municode.com/library/tx/austin/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT25LADE).

You can check the status of your permit application on [Austin Build + Connect](https://abc.austintexas.gov/web/permit/login?reset=true&amp;t_loginAgain=1). To check your permit status, you must create an Austin Build + Connect account and select “My Permits/Cases” from the left side menu.

Note that if you are not the applicant, meaning a hired professional submitted your application, the hired professional will be receiving the approval of your permit application or any review comments. You can request to be sent a copy of any emails if this is the case, or you can simply have your authorized applicant forward them to you.

#### 2. If you receive comments, your plans must be updated

Comments are sent in a Master Comment Report to the email provided on the application.

If you need help understanding your comments, reference the Municipal Code and [glossary](/resources/glossary/) or speak with a professional.

If you have questions or concerns about your comments, reach out to the reviewer associated with the specific comments directly. Their contact information will be located on your comment document.

#### 3. Submit updated plans

Resubmission is done through the same process as your initial application submission.

After you or your hired professional resubmit, you will receive either notice that your plans have been approved or you will receive new comments. Note that if you receive comments a second time, there is an additional $355.68 fee.

#### 4. This process will be repeated until all comments have been addressed and your application is approved

Most applications go through 2 rounds of review. After a second round of review, additional reviews incur a fee of $355.68.

---

### What happens after my application is approved?

When your application is approved, you or your hired professional will receive an email notification stating that your permit and approved plans are ready to be picked up at the [Service Center](/contact/) at One Texas Center. Your permit must be posted somewhere visible on your work site, and then you may begin your project!

Remember, permitting doesn’t stop when you get started. Your work must be inspected throughout your process and when you’re finished in order to close any permits.

## Inspect
{: .step}

Inspections are required throughout your permitted project and when you’re finished to make sure all of your work is safe and sustainable.


<hr>
### What inspections will I need?

When you receive your permit, a list of the required inspections for your project will be printed on the back of your permit.

<hr>
### Who can schedule inspections?

Anyone associated with the permit can schedule an inspection: the general contractor, the homeowner (if listed as the general contractor on the permit), the trade contractor, or their official agents.

<hr>
### How do I schedule my inspections?

Inspections can be scheduled one of three ways.

If you&rsquo;re not already registered, you can register online.</li></ul></div></li></ul></div>

<hr>
### Do I need to be home for my inspection?

When you schedule your inspection, you will find out whether or not you need to be home. If you are not required to be home during your inspection, you must clearly post your permitted plans and your permit for your inspector.

<hr>
### What happens during inspection?

Your inspector will inspect your work based on the approved building plans and their checklists and identify any needed improvements.

* Framing checklist
* Foundation checklist
* Layout checklist

Your inspector is a great source of information to answer questions about meeting your requirements and building your shed safely and sustainably.

<hr>
### Final inspection

Your project is complete once you pass your Final Inspection. Your inspector will email you your Certificate of Occupancy either from their device while they are on your property or when they return to their office. This will close your permit marking your permit as complete in city records.

It is important to close your permit(s) because if you do not, it may prevent you or future homeowners from receiving permits on your property in the future. Learn more about [open and expired permits](/resources/can-i-get-a-permit/).

#### What if I fail my final inspection?

Your inspector will let you know why you did not pass. You must make any needed changes and reschedule your final inspection before your permit expires. 

Permits are only valid for 180 days. However, each time you get an inspection and work is done on the project, your permit is extended an additional 180 days. 

If the required changes are taking longer than 180 days to implement, you may need to extend your permit in person at the  [Service Center](/contact/) at One Texas Center. This requires a you to fill out a Permit Extension/withdrawal/activation form. This type of extension is only permitted once.

Remember, you must pass your final inspection in order to close your permit(s).
