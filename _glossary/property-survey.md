A survey of the exact measurement of the amount of land belonging to a homeowner. Property surveys indicate any easements or special features on the property and measures the distance around the property from each boundary line.

Property surveys are helpful in figuring out where your property lines start and stop. With that information, you can find where the setbacks are located on your property, whether there are any easements on your property, and determine where you can build on your land.

You probably received your survey when you purchased your home if you bought it after 1980. If you can’t find it, or you don’t remember getting it, check with your:

* Home lender or the title company from your original purchase,
* Neighbors to find out where they got theirs,
* Or, you can get a new survey from a surveyor.
