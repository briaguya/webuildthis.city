Property surveys are helpful in figuring out where your property lines start and stop. With that information, you can find where the setbacks are located on your property, whether there are any easements on your property, and determine where you can build on your land.

There are few ways you can find your property survey if you have lost the survey provided to you when you bought your home:

* Check your home’s deed for measurements and boundaries.
* Visit the county recorder’s office and ask to view any public maps of your neighborhood and street, especially those with clear boundary markers of your property.
* Hire a professional surveyor to survey your land and show you by marking your property lines by placing stakes on the corners of your property.
