Easements for public utilities and drainage ways shall be retained in all subdivisions in the widths and locations determined necessary by the single office. All easements shall be dedicated to public use for the named purpose and shall be aligned to minimize construction and future maintenance costs.

You were likely told of any easements on your property when you purchased your home. If you were not, then you can find them on your property survey or by calling 811.
