title: Critical root zone
term: critical-root-zone
short_definition: The ground surrounding a tree where water that drips down from the canopy soaks into the roots.
long_definition_markdown: 'The area around a tree where water drips down from the canopy to the ground and is absorbed by the roots. The size of the critical root zone depends upon the size of the tree- larger trees have larger critical root zones. To calculate the size of the critical root zone (measured in feet), measure the diameter of the tree in inches and multiply it by two.'
