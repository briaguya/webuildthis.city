Impervious cover is any type of man-made or stone surface that doesnâ€™t absorb rainfall.   Surfaces such as stone, rooftops, patios, driveways, sidewalks, roadways, parking lots, and some decks are considered impervious cover. Uncovered wooden decks and unpaved sections of driveways count as 50% impervious cover.                                             Impervious cover does not include sidewalks or easements in the public right-of-way, water features such as ponds, fountains, and water detention basins, porous pavement, or access ramps.   A certain percentage of impervious cover is permitted on the property depending on its zoning designation. To calculate your impervious cover, measure the square footage of impervious surfaces on your property in relation to the square footage of the entire property.
The total area of any surface that prevents the infiltration of water into the ground, such as roads, parking areas, concrete, and buildings. Impervious cover shall be calculated in compliance with the Environmental Criteria Manual and Section 23-3D-3040 (Impervious Cover Calculations).
