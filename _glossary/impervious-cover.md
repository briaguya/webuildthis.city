Impervious cover refers to any type of human-made surface that doesnâ€™t absorb rainfall. Impervious cover restrictions are in place to prevent flooding during and after heavy rains.
<br>
<br>Surfaces that are considered impervious cover include rooftops, patios, driveways, sidewalks, roadways, parking lots, and some decks. Uncovered wooden decks and unpaved portions of driveways count as 50% impervious cover.
<br>
<br>Dependent on zoning designation, a certain percentage of impervious cover is permitted on a property. A reviewer can help you calculate your impervious cover, but if you would like to do it yourself, [download this spreadsheet](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Residential/Calculation_aid.xls) to help determine the square footage of impervious surfaces on your property relative to the square footage of the property as a whole.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Impervious cover does not include sidewalks or easements in the public right of way, water features such as ponds, fountains, and water detention basins, porous pavement, or access ramps.
