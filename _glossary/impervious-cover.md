Impervious cover refers to any type of human-made surface that doesnâ€™t absorb rainfall.
<br>
<br>Surfaces that are considered impervious cover include rooftops, patios, driveways, sidewalks, roadways, parking lots, and some decks. Uncovered wooden decks and unpaved portions of driveways count as 50% impervious cover.
<br>
<br>Dependent on zoning designation, a certain percentage of impervious cover is permitted on a property. To calculate your impervious cover, determine the square footage of impervious surfaces on your property relative to the square footage of the property as a whole.
<br>
<br>Impervious cover does not include sidewalks or easements in the public right of way, water features such as ponds, fountains, and water detention basins, porous pavement, or access ramps.
