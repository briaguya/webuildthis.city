term: impervious cover

  &nbsp;





  Impervious cover is any type of man-made or stone surface that doesn’t absorb
  rainfall.





  Surfaces such as stone, rooftops, patios, driveways, sidewalks, roadways,
  parking lots, and some decks are considered impervious cover. Uncovered wooden
  decks and unpaved sections of driveways count as 50% impervious cover.





  Impervious cover does not include sidewalks or easements in the public
  right-of-way, water features such as ponds, fountains, and water detention
  basins, porous pavement, or access ramps.





  A certain percentage of impervious cover is permitted on the property depending
  on its zoning designation. To calculate your impervious cover, measure the
  square footage of impervious surfaces on your property in relation to the
  square footage of the entire property.

Impervious cover refers to any type of human-made surface that doesn’t absorb rainfall. Impervious cover restrictions are in place to prevent flooding during and after heavy rains.

Dependent on zoning designation, a certain percentage of impervious cover is permitted on a property. A reviewer can help you calculate your impervious cover, but if you would like to do it yourself, [download this spreadsheet](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Planning/Residential/Calculation_aid.xls).
