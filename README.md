## About

This is the new website of the Austin permitting resource tool, currently under active development. The project is being led by a team in the City's [Design, Technology, and Innovation Fellows program][dti].

We're using [sprints], and you're welcome to check out [our Trello board][trello].

## Architecture

Much of this is to be determined; we're using [Jekyll][] as the static site generator and are investigating [GatherContent][] to use as the content editor.

[jekyll]: https://jekyllrb.com
